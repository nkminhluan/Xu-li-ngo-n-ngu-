 They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world
A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company
 Every day was about creating something new
I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University
 The founder of the idea is Jim March
 I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be
 That's the risk of exploitation
 If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit
 So we have lots of great examples
Why is balancing so difficult? I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are
 But we don't only see this in companies
Another trap is the success trap
 And they apply to our companies
 I see other companies that say, "I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes
 think in multiple time scales
 Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company -- suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent
 They need to fund the journey and lead the long term
 be skeptical of success
 When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me? Is that something I should do more of? In my case, yes
 Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered, they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities
 But at the same time, distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other, it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore
 We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth, and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite, and that our Sun's life is also finite
Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check
 How about a few months? That's pretty good too
 And what about macrogravity, or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on?
 So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space
 Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented: the microbe, a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing, living machine
 They're known on Earth as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization
 These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel
 To do so is not particularly easy
 Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation
 Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention, during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements
 But with every passing day, we approach the age of volitional evolution, a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny
 Will engineering ourselves make us less human? But then again, what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious? Where should human genius direct itself? Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it
 The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself, and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe
But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997, when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building
 He is definitely my hero
4 million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns
 And --
 That's the extent to which we agree about background checks
But what about the 300 million guns already out there in homes across America? Well first, it's important to realize that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes of decent, law-abiding people like you and me, who want what we all want -- including keeping our families safe
 In fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns
And every day, people are dying as a result
 They're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision, made based on very bad information that was put into their minds by very bad people, who know good and well the misery that they're causing, but just don't care
Let's look at the political elections that are heating up
 For somebody like me, watching people wave around their negative NRA ratings -- it's almost surreal to watch
 Sometimes I think of it -- you know, we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions, kind of like white blood cells
 And we're marching across the country -- we're not just waiting for Congress to act; that would almost be the definition of insanity
 That is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create around gun violence
And that's my dream, that maybe someday, some period TV show will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence, and a future generation of children might only be able to imagine how terrible it must have been
 My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian, with a pinch of hazel and honey, and a man [who is] a mix of coffee with milk, but with a lot of coffee
 I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head
 By helping in the kitchen at a friend's party, people thought I was the maid
Since then, a new question started to chase me
I portray the subjects in a white background
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries, 19 different cities around the world
 And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro
A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote, "All my life, people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group, a stereotype, a box
 I'm Massiel
 Just to show you some examples, illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies
 They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes
 becomes love
 What happened to interacting with each other? I don't know about you, but I feel limited inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels
 This is Microsoft HoloLens, the first fully untethered holographic computer
 It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with HoloLens, and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED
 Our universe is analog
I think it's because computers give us superpowers
 This is theater -- time and space displaced
 That's displacement of space
 But what if we didn't have to? What if we could have these same digital powers in our world? You can already see glimmers of this, but I believe our children's children will grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology
So how do we get there? For me, the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective
 Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object, or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force
With this perspective, we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix
 Move the dial one way, and you get reality
 Six hundred million humans watched them on grainy, black-and-white televisions
 And the world? The world was mesmerized
 In fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far, let's try doing something else even more crazy
 I had an awesome week
 Well, I'm actually in three places
 This is a precise holographic replica of Mars, built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover, that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth
 But for decades, we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards
 Today, a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before -- an alien world made a little more familiar, because they're finally exploring it as humans should
 Thank you Jeff, this was amazing
 I take inspiration from our ancestors
 It's a phenomenal time to be human
Thank you
 So there's been some talk in the press
 There's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product
 So from that perspective, what you saw -- you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens
 Right?
 The camera has a fish-eye lens on it
 Oh, shit
 And there's holographic Jeff Norris
 I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what
 So in short: to be super crisp, the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye
 That's right
 So we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars
 Thank you so much
 But alluding to the country's continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid, I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach
And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround: [#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]
 But outside of that, I didn't really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places
 But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me
When we moved to Botswana, I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati and nothing else
 When I began to read, I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon, who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness
The year was 2011 and all over southern Africa and the whole continent, affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get
 And my whole world did open up
 It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi
 When Burundians flee political turmoil, they go to us, to other African countries
 But political Pan-Africanism is usually the African unity of the political elite
 On a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive, we are in desperate need of something new, something that works
" And I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together
 Access to these online networks has given young Africans something we've always had to violently take: a voice
 Before now, if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government, you were pushed to protest, suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care
 Dead Things
 Huh
 So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner
 We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it, and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it
 It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab: collagen
 Collagen is what gives structure to our bones
 And he found a match
Now, when you hear the word "camel," what may come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia
 But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these, the dromedary, quintessential desert creature -- hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara, has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks, has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes
 Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel
 I know, wouldn't that be great?
 And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa
 You'd have blizzards
 Like, how 
 So it helps heat dissipate easier
So I was trained as a historian
And, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew
 Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds: veterans, military spouses, retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats
 Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers
 Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition, and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers, especially if they've been out for a long time
 Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took a five-year career break early in her career
And this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break
 I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work
 Expect that, and don't be discouraged by it
 And that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time
 We did that already
The first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete
 I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3
Back in 2010 I started noticing something
 I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs
" I have to thank the editors there for that title, and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns
 These internships are paid, and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries
 Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship? Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews, and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over
Think about how far we have come
 Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012, but they made it even more interesting and challenging, because they knew what Tracy could handle
 But in the meantime, if you are returning to work after a career break, don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program
 I had no interest in being a public servant, I had no interest in criminal law, and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor
My third year of law school, I defended people accused of small street crimes, mostly mentally ill, mostly homeless, mostly drug-addicted, all in need of help
 They were in need of our assistance
 History has conditioned us to believe that somehow, the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety, despite evidence to the contrary
 With a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing
 The more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system, the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again -- all a tremendous social cost to his children, to his family and to his peers
When I came out of law school, I did the same thing as everybody else
 Our power is virtually boundless
 And I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where, and before I knew it, this young man was hugging me
 He never faced a judge or a jail, he never had a criminal record
 Christopher had accomplished -- and making a lot more money than me --
 An employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one
 I saw myself -- a young person in need of intervention
And that's how we do it in Boston
 I even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school, that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack, he put a loaded 9-millimeter
So why should this matter to you? Well, one, we're spending a lot of money
 Our money
Thank you
 He was swiping through pictures on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically
 And the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here, it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together
 And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite
 We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them
 And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for or learning from, and I can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control
 in the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think
 And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware -- we buy it for the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will
 And I don't know about you, but living inside of Windows scares me
 In other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer
Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this brand-new form of user experience
The second interface guideline we call "touch to see
 Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception -- that's the sense of our body parts in space
 So again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind
 It's right here, inside of us
So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today, it's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future, it's right here in 2016
And in point of fact, I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind
And -- There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about
 We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty
 It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine of a kid who was my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a distended belly
 Well, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dropped out and dropped in and started my family
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children, since they saw that vision
 If you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?", 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s
 From 1970 until today, the percentage of the world's population living in starvation levels, living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation, that percentage has declined by 80 percent
 That's something we ought to celebrate
 It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind, and it happened in our lifetimes
 And I went in search of an answer
 You know what, I still don't care
 I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists left, right and center
 Here's what I learned
 Capitalism is not just about accumulation
Now, I want to tell you about a second epiphany that's related to that first one that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world, but right here at home
Who said it? It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan
 Why do I know it by heart? Because he said it to me
 And I thought, this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today
 What? It's coming together around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help people who need us the most
 Think about it
" You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry
 It's impossible
How do we solve it? Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences
 That is diversity in which lies our strength
 Remember what pulled up the poor
 There's no other way
 A lot of it's on this stage
 Phenomenal
 Yes
 Don't we? Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable? Kinda conventional? Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you? Why is that dangerous? Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, conservatives, you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government
 And on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality
 But when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today, those are distractions
 We need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets
 Number one
 We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools
 We're blessed with people who listen to us
 We're blessed with leadership
One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the United States
 And those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report
Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own
 This means there's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States
And we included a unique matching system where if Mike's first victim had come forward, saved her record, entered into the matching system and named Mike, and Mike's second victim had done the same thing a few months later, they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time for investigation and follow up
Thank you
you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil
And I would want to do that like that
 And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option
 It was way too big a project
But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here
"
That did not happen
 I actually brought them here to show you today
Then --
Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago
 After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom
"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today
 And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle
 I call it the Dark Playground
 It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening
 And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
 It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past
 And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me
 And guess who woke up?
Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages
 These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students
 These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them
 And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved
 We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life
 That's a job for all of us
 And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today
I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata
 It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale
 And he buys a piece of art that I made
Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired
 As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, "So where are you staying tonight?" And he makes it worse by saying, "Actually, I don't have a place
This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective
 The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me
 And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out
 Ha!"
Here's what we pitched investors: "We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over
 It's going to be huge!"
 I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone
 Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone
 Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left
That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now --
is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home
Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?
 It's hard for people to leave bad reviews
 The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases
Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure
 If you share too little, like, "Yo," acceptance rates go down
 Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain
 Turns out, people are justified in their trust
 And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you
 Highly recommended!"
 But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for
 They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents
 Hospitality has been around forever
 Packed into a room just like this, but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric, with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it
So I went to church as often as I could
 All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself
but I knew I could do it
But planning time was over now
 We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me
 And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer, I might go right on with her
 And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still
 And the organ rolled on in to add the the dirge
 And the heat came on to add to the sweat
 I had dipped my head not once, but twice in that snot-inducing baptism pool
 Now what?
 It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong
" But as the Congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me
this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer
We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line
 It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning
 There was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars
But as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes
 The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, it asks that you believe a new thing: that it is possible not to believe
Our national dress is unique, but this is not the only thing that's unique about my country
 Our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique, and this is what I'd like to speak about today, our promise to remain carbon neutral
Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas
 The reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country doing our best to survive
 All citizens are guaranteed free school education, and those that work hard are given free college education
 We manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully, and because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH, which is development with values
 And yes, we celebrate our national dress, too
 That's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world, and that's why we are a carbon neutral country
 Actually, that's not quite accurate
 Our entire country generates 2
 Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist
 A few years ago, a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below
We first made this promise in 2009 during COP 15 in Copenhagen, but nobody noticed
 What was different in Paris was that governments came round together to accept the realities of climate change, and were willing to come together and act together and work together
 We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program, and we are planting trees throughout our country through Green Bhutan, another national program
 They are our lungs
 So every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting, mining and pollution in our parks, and resources to help communities who live in those parks manage their forests, adapt to climate change, and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature
This is why His Majesty the King started Bhutan For Life
 It is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks, to protect our parks, until our government can take over on our own fully
 Naturally, I'm pretty excited
 So in closing, I'd like to share one more dream that I have
 After all, there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face
 This man was extremely successful: he was confident and powerful
 He was diagnosed with Parkinson's
Parkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system, which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult
 My uncle started using a walker to walk, and to take a turn, he literally had to take one step at a time, like this, and it took forever
And he's not the only one in the world
 As designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems, one solution that solves it all, but it need not always be like that
 It looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person, and that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in
All this while, I was interviewing him, questioning him, and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information, or just answers to my questions
 So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks, while he's eating, while he's watching TV
 So he told me, "Well, let me show you how I do it
So he took really long to reach this position, and then all this while, I'm thinking, "Oh my God, is he really going to do it? Is he really, really going to do it without his walker?" And then 
 So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land
 And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him, but the one that finally worked was this one
 Let's take a look
 What we need are human-centered solutions
 Break them, boil them down into much smaller problems, and then find simple solutions for them
 Imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions
Well, I'm an ocean chemist
 I look at the chemistry of the ocean today
 I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past
 It was collected from close to Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea, so, very different than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday
 If you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea, you know it gets colder as you go down, and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense
 Gases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 -- that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past -- and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions
 And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day, you see that temperature increased
 It didn't increase smoothly
 Looks beautiful, right? Great, if you're not a great mariner
 Sometimes it looks a little more like this
 Everyone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick, so it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is
 These are deep sea sponges, meter scale
 It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like
 And the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals, depends on the temperature; it depends on the pH, it depends on the nutrients
 This is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague, Brendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii
 So going along, there's giant sharks everywhere, there are pyrosomes, there are swimming holothurians, there's giant sponges, but I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor
 On the right-hand side, we've taken that same piece of coral, put it in a nuclear reactor, induced fission, and every time there's some decay, you can see that marked out in the coral, so we can see the uranium distribution
 And essentially, the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean
 We went up and down sea mountains
 We think back in the glacial, from the analysis we've made in the corals, that the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon, and there was a low-density layer sitting on top
 This is a spectacular coral garden
 It's just a beautiful place
 Other places, GMO is saving the world
 Welcome to your global farm
 We built a huge analog farm
 What if you could take this apple, digitize it somehow, send it through particles in the air and reconstitute it on the other side? What if?
Going through some of these quotes, you know, they inspire me to do what I do
 The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70 percent of their own food
 In India: farmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities, more farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that
 So how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?
 And I built silly things and I made plants dance and I attached them to my computer and I killed them all -- a lot
I eventually got them to survive
 They said, "Knock yourself out, kid! Here's an old electronics room that nobody wants
 What can you do?"
 But the most interesting thing? Beautiful, white roots, deep, green colors and a monthly harvest

 So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the pH of a lettuce within 
I'm like, "No, that's 6
This lettuce that day was hyper sweet
 It was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!" And the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me
 They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity
 These are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address
And I mean it -- it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium
 And they may not friend us back -- I don't know, they might friend us back, it depends on how we act
And so -- inside of this environment, we're experimenting with all kinds of things
 We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is perfect world
 These tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years
 But we've done things with protein -- we've grown all kinds of things
 He sets it to 100 and what happens? It starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip
And he says, "Oh
We've created an interface for this that's much like a game
 While it's growing, they make changes
 They're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad? It kills people
Here's one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school in three weeks' time
 The plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant
 We're in that weird "We're alright" stage and it's like, "Here's my black box --" "No, buy mine
" "No, no, no -- I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable
 When we ask for more, cheaper food, we're now asking for better, environmentally friendly food
What does this look like in a world? You remember the world connected by strings? We start having beacons
 We start sending information about food, rather than sending food
 But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo
 In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave
 And it doesn't just end in fifth grade
 This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence
And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers
"I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling
 Yeah
 Like, the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly
 More power to you
 And if it had survived, the future of transportation would probably already be here
And so people jumped on board, and not just in Los Angeles but across the country
 100 years later
 So what happened? Well, within a year this thing had taken off
 And that phenomenon had gone global
 160 billion dollars in lost productivity, of course also sitting in traffic, and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in
5 million cars that go over those bridges every day
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago
 But the part that I'm really --
Now, in China everything is supersized, and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month, that's 500,000 per day
 So the question for us is: well, how do we turn all of these commuter cars -- and literally there's tens of millions of them -- how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?
 So 54 cents a mile, what is that? Well, that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile
So first of all, last week I think it was, I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber and I couldn't find the app
 Well, first I should probably just say, well, what we were trying to accomplish
 And to be more iconic, because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit, and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin
Now, inside, we felt like -- I guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work, but on the outside that wasn't evident
 It seems to me, everywhere you turn, you're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time
 So even in New York -- We have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" -- compare the earnings September after September after September
 And we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down
 You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve, that's a really sad math professor
 But we don't want just any math problem, we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find, and we want the one that if you solve it, there's a little bit of a wow factor
 Explain that again -- at which time?
 Sorry, I missed that
 And we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious
And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge, but one for optimistic leadership, Where instead of resisting -- resisting technology, maybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry -- we have to embrace it or be a part of the future
 It will take a lot longer than I think we all expect, especially that transition period
 We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined
 We lament the existence of human smugglers, and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care
 In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety
 Let's call her Amira
 Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you, Homs, a once beautiful and historic city now under rubble
 There's restricted economic activity
 And around the world, some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years
 But there, there's great difficulty as well
 Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work
So there's a third alternative, and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking
 I think we can reconsider that choice
 It gives them freedom of movement
 Against the odds of extreme constraint, refugees are innovating, and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay
 But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use
 It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago, and a pilot will begin in the summer
It could also be used at the national level, where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees
 If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages
And this is an idea that has been applied
 And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee
There is a historical precedent for it as well
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden
So you go to the doctor and get some tests
 You have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you've been blue, haven't felt like yourself, you haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do
 Think things should go OK
 We totally depend on what we call "post-marketing surveillance," after the drugs hit the market
So let me tell you a data science story
 It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today, but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs
 Glucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes
He did it
 It's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose, because it's core to our practice
 So it's great, good job, but not really that interesting, definitely not publishable
He said, "I know, Russ
 And I said, "Let's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose
So we said, what can we do? And we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt, who also -- Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville, who also have electronic medical records similar to ours
More interestingly, we had left out diabetics, because diabetics already have messed up glucose
 When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20
 This was a big deal, and we said, "We've got to publish this
 We had not done a single real experiment
 We found somebody who knew about lab stuff
 And lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice
So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone, but we added a little note at the end, saying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up
 They could and they should
 I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research and I said, "We wanted to do this study, Google said no, it's kind of a bummer
" He said, "Well, we have the Bing searches
"
 Now I felt like I was --
" I said, "Now you're talking!" This was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft
" And we did first a baseline
5 to one percent of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words
 If people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms -- and one of those words, the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words, if you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word
 They were interested
What do I take from this? Why tell this story? Well, first of all, we have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really, fundamentally, drug actions
 How do drugs work? This will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use
 We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time
 It's a blue sky, open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs
 If we think about drug treatment today, all the major breakthroughs -- for HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes -- it's always a cocktail of drugs
But when I started this over 10 years ago, I didn't have a word for it, I didn't have any ambitious notions about it, I had no visions of grandeur
 I call this the Alpha Piece
 I wanted to analyze it
 And I realized something
I think we've all become desensitized by our overdeveloped cities that we live in, and billboards and advertisements, and giant parking lots, and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore
So at this point, my curiosity grew
 And that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft and showed me that there was this common language I had with the rest of the world
If you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're capable of doing -- building houses and furniture, and painting giant murals -- and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone
So as we ponder the future, know that your future might not be so seamless
 And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow
In my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation
 They are becoming more compressed and more threatened
 The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged, wild coast
 Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run, I know they don't see me as prey
From the shores of Africa we travel east, across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands
However, when plankton densities increase, the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains, and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after
 The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable
 And through my photography, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans
There are a few things that all of us need
 We need shelter and love
 And we all need a safe place to pee
 Trans people and trans issues, they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately
Public bathrooms
 I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about, and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection
 I'm a trans person
 Have you heard about these? They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth
If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone, then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places
 And she couldn't hold her pee any longer
 She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her
 So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter, and I did
 I said yes, I had, but not for a really long time
 It happens
 Right? She doesn't need to know that, I figure
 When you get old like me, you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer, I promised her
And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority, or it's too expensive, or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality, or your masculinity, or your religious beliefs, then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully, does care about the rest of the population
Thank you for listening
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy
But there were daunting challenges
 I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what lay in store for Africa
 I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic
 But I was not talking about structural change
 And on the sugar plantations, which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise, 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-positive
 Infection rates climbed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa
 So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS
 Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power; and violence because its impact -- premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent
 I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, even when it makes me uncomfortable
 In New York City, premature mortality -- that's death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones
 These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word "racism" in our research and our work
 You've probably felt something every time I've said it
As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great injustice: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities; the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child
I believe big institutions have unique potential to create change, and I believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take
 My mother escaped North Korea when she was 10 years old
 To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life: repressive governments, occupying armies and even armed border patrols
 Instead of running away from big institutions, I've actually run toward them
 It's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires
 Do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have? Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?
"This one cup helps save the planet
 Put in the wrong words like "promote social justice," and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely, according to this fable
 But here was the weird thing: 54 percent of the people still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks, they thought that they would make less money
But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right? The serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round, they need to stick to making more money
 So, Harvard Business School actually researched this, and they found something fascinating
 Post-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation, where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process
 And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views
Now, sustainable investing, the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret, and it's not just for the elite
 It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies
 It's about all the things we already see in the market today
 It now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States
 That one's actually true
When I was 17, I decided to come out
 I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed
 jihad 
" And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage
 I get it that people were angry at the terrorists
 When are we going to get rid of them?" So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes
 And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually get radicalized at mosques
 Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS
 He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS
 What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community
 It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles
 Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school
 She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed
 He shot Deah eight times
Thank you
 Thank you so much

 And the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours, 365 days a year
 Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century
 The hottest of all was last year
But on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans
 And more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years
 Take a look at this storm last August
The insurance industry has certainly noticed, the losses have been mounting up
 And the causality requires a moment of discussion
 Every storm is different now
 We're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century
Speaking of the North Pole, last December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest, raised temperatures at the North Pole 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night
 And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts, it raises sea level
So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up, there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned
 I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages, but it's the same thing
 A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis
We're going to win this
 We are going to prevail
 The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic
 And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more
 And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world
 And in many areas, they don't exist
" And it's an ever-firmer "yes
We are solving this crisis
 Almost 400,000 people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this
 And so, I am extremely optimistic
" But eight years and two months later, in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon, there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston
 Here's a little-known fact about that: the average age of the systems engineers, the controllers in the room that day, was 26, which means, among other things, their age, when they heard that challenge, was 18
 One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US, Wallace Stevens, wrote a line that has stayed with me: "After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,' and on that 'yes', the future world depends
 And then came a yes
 Some still doubt that we have the will to act, but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource
 I think that the crossing -- you know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years
 But it matters a lot how fast we win it
 If this turns out to be the year, that the partisan thing changes, as you said, it's no longer a partisan issue, but you bring along people from the other side together, backed by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities, backed by reason that you win the day -- boy, that's really exciting
Now, for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space
 There are no external cameras
"
 The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice, improve its performance over time
 For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight? Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question
 It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons, no other actuators, no other control surfaces, just a simple propeller
 Even though it's mechanically simple, there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space
 And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night
 What can you do with all this surplus? The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric
 This gives it an extraordinary capability
 Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly
 When you put them together, they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter
 We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters, each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms
 That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway
Thank you
 I mean, you know, they're black holes
3 billion years ago, Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life
In early September of 2015, LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details
 And they passed through the detector
 So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT, who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO, for the past 23 years
 "It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands
 And that's preposterous
So towards the end of his classic text on gravity, LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows: He said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous
 And that's really useful, because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you, by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you
 Instead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds
 And at least for LIGO, the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band
 If the two black holes are non-spinning, you get a very simple chirp: whoop! If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp, but with a modulation on top of it, so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir! It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform
[Whirring sound]
 
 Two black holes, the densest thing in the Universe, one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns, whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide
 Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible
 Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe, to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos
So a while ago, I tried an experiment
 My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone
" as though she's a Southern waitress
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup
The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes
 Almost
 Dream job
Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four
 A new episode made every nine days times four shows, so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 16 episodes going on at all times: 24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal," 15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder," 10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV, that's 350 million dollars for a season
 For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air
 It is painting a canvas
 It is hitting every high note
 Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic
Maybe it's called genius
 I don't know
 I am that hum
 Overworked, overused, overdone, burned out
 The hum of the engine died
 My hum was broken
 Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time 
And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question
And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things
 One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything, and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey
 Nothing out of the ordinary
 All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of
 The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe
 Play is the opposite of work
 I feel it
 A hum creeps back
 Not at full volume, barely there, it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there
 It's just love
 No secret
 The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan, that's just a replacement
 The real hum is love-specific
 The real hum is singular and original
 I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work
 I work all the time because I like working
Well, me
 We play with balls
 I itch for my cell phone always
 My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up
 You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet
 Your child does not think you're that interesting
 It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes
 If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes
And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I'm Parent of the Year
 Find what makes you feel good
 I don't need that hum
I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world
 My brain is still global
 My campfires still burn
 The more I play, the freer my mind becomes
I said yes to less work and more play
Wanna play?
All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food?
 We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other
 According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day
 It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell
 I talk to people that I like
 I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it
 So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists
 Don't multitask
 Don't think about your argument you had with your boss
 If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog
 If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion
 If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney
 And you don't want to be like that
 You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn
 "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't
 We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop
 And, more importantly, it is not about you
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity
 Try not to repeat yourself
 It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot
 Don't do that
 So forget the details
 This is not the last one, but it is the most important one
 I'm the center of attention
 You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place
One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief
 And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap
 And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon
 I think that we are approaching this dream
 I often had to take care of patients with head trauma
 You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure
 And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure
 And to do that, you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain
 Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family
 So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells
 And that's what he saw under his microscope
And that was, for us, a major surprise
 So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater
 And they never die, they're immortal cells
 But these cells behave differently
 All of you have them in your brain
 They have a very important role during the development stage
 The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab
 And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope
 Those are the cells that were re-implanted
 And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture
So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells
 So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered
 Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells
 We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on
 The biggest obstacles are regulations
 If you project yourself -- having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available?
 So, it's very difficult to say
 It depends, first, on the approval of the trial
 So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment
 And safe, of course
 One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race: White, black, Asian, or Native American
" So I check "black," but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically
 When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina, we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world
" And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes
Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine, and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution
 But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind
 Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being
Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes
In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed
 For one thing, black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people
 It's a well-known function called "correcting for race
 I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity
 It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us
 Thank you
 In the last 150 years, in developed countries, on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller
This challenge is staggering -- so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years
 For so, so many reasons, we need to change our global food production systems
But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice
 And aside from being healthy, it's also a lot more exciting and diverse
 And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently
 We were inspired by Sylvia Earle, who won the TED Prize in 2009
 Amy was there as the TED Prize Director; me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen, love to dive, passion for the oceans
Mission Blue truly changed our lives
And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it
 Fish chills
How much we've learned since
 For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught for human consumption, there's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed, mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil
This is madness
 Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it
Now, we know that the oceans have far more problems -- they have pollution, there's acidification, coral reef destruction and so on
How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate, whatever it was
 It's not fun
 New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural, with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae
 I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example
 Software systems that gather data across farms, so we can improve farm practices
So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt
 We want to eat good and healthy
 We're all the same
 And all of us will benefit
 The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event, called the burning of the manuscripts "a crime against world cultural heritage
" And he was right -- or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying
 What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy, this time by climate
 The real number is likely double that, and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps
 How much better to be a participant in the past, an adventurer in an undiscovered country, searching for the hidden text
And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career
 And to my surprise, he actually wrote back
 Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz
 And once we capture these images, we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them, using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA
 This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged, and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church
 That's why I founded the Lazarus Project, a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever
 In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke
 That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call "textual science
Last year, a student in my class, a freshman, with a background in Latin and Greek, was image-processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome
 As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text
 This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud
However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized
 And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision
 Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay
 And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application
We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people
 So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it
 So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do "research" --
But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do
 Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go
So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book
 Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration
 And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone
And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use
 But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting
 So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system
 And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals
 We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical
 But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically
 So with that, I will leave you
In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25? In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation
 And yet today, the largest emerging economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark
Economic growth matters
 Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual
 You worry about the overpopulation of the planet
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state
 And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly
In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today? Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer -- a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants
 Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies
 Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction
Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth
Thank you
 I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times
 Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion
 So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources
 But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes
 I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded
I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know
 Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED
 DM: Thank you very much
 By the way, all that is through Special Olympics
 That's the word "retard" or "retarded" used in a derogatory manner
 They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends
 There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies, and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability
 Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities
 Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer
 Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over
 When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging, supportive, and let me be myself without being judged
 Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games
 Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team
 Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field
 People don't think it's insulting, but it is
 Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance
 This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from 165 countries around the world
 Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves
Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer
I am no longer hidden, bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk
 The next time someone uses the r-word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hurts
 Nelson Mandela said, "Sports has the power to change the world
" Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and get to feel like and be champions
You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria
 But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change
 This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia
 And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus
 And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally -- that's what drives it
 We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that
 These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word "Kenema," the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, is named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent and open to the public gaze
 It could even be disseminated intentionally
 The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important
Simple, right? Well, after a while, our creative brains say, "You know what? You can use this for more than just remembering where food is
Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, "Hey, I want to be cool
Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits
 What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process 
 She started to become disenchanted with her behavior
 And it tries it's hardest to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie
And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go
 This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible
 And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding
 These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving that we choke on
In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being
So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment
 It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops 
Instead of see text message, compulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat
As a boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru
And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them, "Go to the Amazon
 You'll find all the gold you want there
The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled
All this became a childhood memory
 You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, but they're generally associated with volcanoes
 "No, Andrés, she's not kidding
"
"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"]
But then 
 And here, at this site, is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water
 I was handed a mug, a tea bag and, well, pointed towards the river
 They take in its vapor
 They cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it
 Intense
Fault-fed hot springs
 The river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path
 Yes? Good
 So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes
 Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly
 They turn this milky-white color
 Leave them marinating for a little longer
How can a boiling river exist like this? I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude
Basically, it works like this: So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets
 We refer to this as the geothermal gradient
 Spencer Wells, and Dr
 It's us
There remains so much to explore
 Al Gore
And that is how programming started for me
 But then, there were other things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy
 They are really, really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like, "What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?" And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers
 It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers
And they are partly right about that
 And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them
 And Ruby also introduced me to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture
 And idealistic foxes, and so on
 
 And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things
 And in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia
Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices
 Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic
 In Bali, we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day
 We know that changes the image you may have of our island
 And those that don't even make it to the ocean, they're either burned or littered
 So we decided to do something about it
 And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island
 Walking home that day, we agreed that we also wanted to be significant
 Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant? We wanted to do something now
" MW: In the years that we have been campaigning, we have learned a lot
 The volunteer team includes children from all over the island, from both international and local schools
Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed
 a petition with one million signatures
 But, who would have guessed one million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?
 Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year
 How cool is that?
 And thanks to the attraction of Green School, we had access to a steady stream of celebrities
 leadership,
 teamwork,
 and we learned about the importance of commitment
 What were these two girls doing? We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike -- we could have gone to jail
 But, hey, it worked
 We never had a business plan, nor a fixed strategy, nor any hidden agendas -- just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us
 Us kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population, but we are 100 percent of the future
 And my goal is to understand how this works
There are four main components behind animal locomotion
 And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot
 And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models
 It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans
 And in fact, the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate, so it's almost a living fossil, which gives us access to our ancestor, the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods
 Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking, at a low level of stimulation, and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation
 And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller
So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail, and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany
So let's look at how close it is to the real animal
 But you see at the end, we have a very close match, and we were very, very happy with this
 And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits
And this is how it looks
 So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot
 For instance, when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait, and at some point, if we stimulate a lot, very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait
Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop, meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops
 And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans
 So the robot -- We have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection, so this robot is now seeing you
"No! You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body? That can't be right
 I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer, let alone a patent lawyer
 So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit
Consider Abigail, a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome, a serious heart condition that, if left untreated, can result in sudden death
Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients
 And you can't patent laws of nature -- the law of gravity, E = mc2
 These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none
As we delved into this issue, we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts -- scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers
 All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero
Why is that? Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge, and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough," seemed all the more reason to take on this fight
We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics, a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah
 Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer
This is Kathleen Maxian
 The family was relieved
 It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science
 So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention, and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature, we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like: What's a gene? What's DNA? How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?
 And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors, like gold
 We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet
 This was a really big deal, totally unexpected
 So even with this remarkable development, we expected to lose
 Ends up split decision, 2 to 1
"
Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives, and it agreed to hear ours
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway, moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career
 I was clearly more nervous than he was
 But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories, the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical, patient advocacy, environmental and religious organizations, who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case
 Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree
"
 The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish, with many twists and turns along the way
And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals
 And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are
 One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules
 And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me, because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science, and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves
T
 It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about
 They're only about the size of my finger, and they spend about 99
Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish
 These lizardfish come in many varieties, and they look almost exactly alike under white light
One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlevé
 They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head
 And here's our footage
 You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse
 So I'm, like, a coral biologist
 Here it is
 I was like, this is gorgeous
 It's creating contrast that they can indeed see
 So we have a model, showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns
 And males and females also have, we're finding, distinct patterns among them
 So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles, which, again, this is only one month old, but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision
 So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon
 And below 1,000 meters, we encountered the bioluminescent zone, where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking
 The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle
 Some corals could be 1,000 years old
 So my dream is something like this
 At night, I'm in a submarine, I have force-feedback gloves, and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine, where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars, and we can conduct our research
 From deep space, our universe looks like a human brain cell, and then here we are in the deep ocean, and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind
Democracy
 We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture
 We tend to think of it as an intransigent given
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remain democracy free
 I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy
 One peak you understand -- you know it, you recognize it -- is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world
 We all recognize the mountain of debts
 A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy
1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices
Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated
It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate
Indeed, I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism
 If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve
 And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce
 It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference
The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian
 But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy
 That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say --
 In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy
 Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill
 John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process
 So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second
But you know what happens
 When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically
 Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future
 For example? YV: Anybody who looks back --
 Of course I made mistakes
 And there wasn't
 And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, "This was a colossal mistake
"
 My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive
 Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union
 And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike
 We definitely hope you are wrong on that point
Imagine you're in Rome, and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums
 At last -- a long corridor, a stair and a door
 Instead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?
 The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story, a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel
 The first one was rather limited in scope
 The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage; and the third, when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global
 With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family, this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent
But genius rose to the challenge
 He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV, and he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power
 And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope, but this man's legacy to the Vatican -- it wasn't fortresses and artillery, it was art
 Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty, and he was right
 So what's he doing? Is he creating land? Is he creating sea? Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, "It is good
And then Michelangelo threw a curveball
 No, she's not an afterthought
 Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women -- so much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling, is the creation of woman, not Adam
You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling
 You have Noah
 It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn
 You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers
 They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward
 They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles -- they're just like athletes
Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography, too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time
 This work of art was almost destroyed because of that
 The printing press made sure that everybody saw it
 And so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks
 It was something that happened over the space of 20 years of editorials and complaints, saying to the Church, "You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives
 No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement
 Too many people want to see this there, and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did
 But also realize, even when you're in those days, with 28,000 people a day, even those days when you're in there with all those other people, look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from 500 years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you, looking upwards with their jaws dropped
 When you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections and you think: dashed hopes
 And so here I was in the year 2009, actually, at the end of 2009, in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge
" And I thought to myself, "Three simple steps to a mega solution
 So with this in hand, I felt confident that I would be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity
"
And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis
 Can a computer write poetry? This is a provocative question
 Am I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?
 So let's try another test
 Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut
 Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary
 So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online, so we have results
 Ribbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material
 
 So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence
 Therefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test, Gertrude Stein is a computer
 What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather, is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness
 So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earlier today, we say that William Blake is more of a human than Gertrude Stein
 Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer
 It simply means that the category of the human is unstable
 This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact
 We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us
The food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand
That percentage of 70 percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change
 Much of Africa, in fact, much of the world, is going to be in trouble
 All living, actively metabolizing organisms, from microbes to you and I, are comprised predominately of water
 And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us, about 95 percent water, and they can lose a little bit more than us, like 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species, but for short periods only
 Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs
 Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies
 The next time the rainy season comes, they germinate and grow, and the whole cycle just starts again
The other reason for looking at a number of plants, is that, at least initially, I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing? Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die?
So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance, in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level
 What are the proteins made in response to drying? Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites, so we look at the metabolome
Now, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground
 They're held as membranes because they're in water
I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application
So you probably all know that genes are made of double-stranded DNA
So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa
And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize, where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance
I'm an underwater explorer, more specifically a cave diver
 Instead of exploring outer space, I wanted to explore the wonders of inner space
Now, a lot of people will tell you that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors
 I mean, imagine yourself here in this room, if you were suddenly plunged into blackness, with your only job to find the exit, sometimes swimming through these large spaces, and at other times crawling beneath the seats, following a thin guideline, just waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath
 Well, that's my workplace
 It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf, and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology and search for life-forms beneath the ice
 So imagine that: these are like little swimming dinosaurs
 So it's been picked up by wind, blown across the Atlantic Ocean
 In places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba, we're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves, and they tell us a lot about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions
And here comes the second term into play, what I call "narrative hybrids" -- structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create
This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster, which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA
 And we wanted to ask ourselves, could a building be about a completely different quality? Could it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration, rather than isolation? So we took this needle and bent it back into itself, into a loop of interconnected activities
But of course, it's not a number, it is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building, and in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture, we identified five characters, hypothetical characters, and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building, thought of where they would meet, what they would experience
 This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing
But of course, there's another story to this building
 This is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces
 We first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight through the year
 We further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors, so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that, again, would enhance the quality of those spaces available for the inhabitants
 And he built Exhibition Road, a linear sequence of those institutions
 It can function as a double-loaded corridor, has daylight, has ventilation
In June 2010, Internet changed my life forever
I could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something
 Whatever was happening had to stop
 We worked together for hours and hours
 We were crowdsourcing ideas from the people
 I saw a spark of hope
 Egyptians on social media were wondering, "If Tunisia did it, why can't we?" I posted an event on Facebook and called it "A Revolution against Corruption, Injustice and Dictatorship
" I posed a question to the 300,000 users of the page at the time: "Today is the 14th of January
 I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt
 And three days later, Mubarak was forced to step down
 It was a time of great hope
 They all shared the belief that we could actually live together despite our differences, that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all
 The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers -- the army supporters and the Islamists
 People in the center, like me, started feeling helpless
First, we don't know how to deal with rumors
 It's as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars
 Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs
Fifth -- and in my point of view, this is the most critical -- today, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations
 We need to work hard on figuring out how technology could be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem
But what if we put more focus on quality? What is more important: the total number of readers of a post you write, or who are the people who have impact that read what you write? Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations, rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time? Or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with? And also, make it socially acceptable that we change our minds, or probably even reward that? What if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds, and that becomes part of our social media experience? If I could track how many people are changing their minds, I'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that, rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me and "liking" because I just confirmed their biases
"
Today, I believe if we want to liberate society, we first need to liberate the Internet
Laugh if you want to, but I'm telling the truth
And even with that, my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis
 There was a love for the city that I loved, that I grew up in, that I was educated in -- a city that pulled my heart back into the system
And I said, you know what? We gotta do something different
 I had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything that I had been trained to do
 We still did it because we listened to that inner spirit, because I realized this: if I was to see real police reform in the communities that I had authority over for public safety, we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'
 And we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them
 It just look good!
That's a great arm -- protection! That's who we are, but we've exercised it so much sometimes that it has led to abuse
So you look at the other arm, and then you look at it and 
 there it is
 And because we are a proud profession, it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes
 Because every one of us makes up a community
" We had mentors throughout all of the community
 I believe they have shifted over the last 10, 20 years from being community churches, where you walk outside your door, round the corner and you're in church
 They shifted from that and became commuter churches
 And they don't take care of that community
 We all take responsibility in this
 It is never too late
 We began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence
 It would take care of itself
And so we gave them some of that
 And in a short period of time, the city went to a 30-year crime low
But I gotta tell you this: these last few years, as much as we had learned to become great proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive, these last years have disappointed me
 I believe -- I truly believe --
that we will be great again
 The auditorium was empty
 This one had this harsh, tinny upper register, because all the felt had worn away
 It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House
 Now she got a piano tuner, but she couldn't get a new piano
 But also, because the piano was so quiet, he had to set up these rumbling, repetitive riffs in the bass
It's an electrifying performance
 But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct
 We've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty, certain kinds of obstacle, can actually improve our performance
 For example, the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer, a few years ago, teamed up with high school teachers
 and so they learned more
 They had weak filters, they had porous filters -- let a lot of external information in
 You tweak it, you test it, you improve it
 And the reason for that is the trouble with the step-by-step process, the marginal gains, is they can walk you gradually down a dead end
The three friends and the stranger, even though the stranger didn't have any extra information, even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness, the three friends and the stranger, they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer
But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job, but how they felt about it
 So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends, they had a nice time, they also thought they'd done a good job
 When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger, they had not had a nice time -- it's actually rather difficult, it's rather awkward 
 They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had
Because, yeah -- the ugly font, the awkward stranger, the random move 
 His name is Brian Eno
 Amplify them
 The musicians hate them
So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist, working with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album, and at one point he turns to Brian and says, "Brian, this experiment is stupid
" But the thing is it was a pretty good album, but also, Carlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies
 And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies because he's realized something
 Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you
The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally, they were just a list -- list on the recording studio wall
The list didn't work
 whether it's sheer willpower, whether it's the flip of a card or whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager, all of us, from time to time, need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano
He said, "We will start with smaller quantity," -- I was like, aww -- and then he said, "of 25 kgs
The worth should be about $2

"
I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house, but there's definitely something going on
 He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well
"
I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties
 Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them

 It was getting a bit out of hand
So I figured I had to knock it on the head
" And he agreed

 I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear --
 All I'm doing is wasting their time

" I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela
"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION

 But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape!
 Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious

I said, "Of course

Our grandparents' generation created an amazing system of canals and reservoirs that made it possible for people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water
 In terms of economic development, it was a great investment
 The city became so concerned about this that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the "Third Straw" to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake
The challenges associated with providing water to a modern city are not restricted to the American Southwest
 In the year 2007, the third largest city in Australia, Brisbane, came within 6 months of running out of water
 A similar drama is playing out today in São Paulo, Brazil, where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in 2010, to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the 2016 Summer Olympics
For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the world's great cities, we've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought
Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors
I think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think that's to open up four new local sources of water that I liken to faucets
 If we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years, we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought
The first source of local water supply that we need to develop to solve our urban water problem will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities
I think there's a lot more practical way to harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities, and that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground
The second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes out of our sewage treatment plants
 Because once we build the first few water recycling systems close to the sewage treatment plant, we have to build longer and longer pipe networks to get that water to where it needs to go
 The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals, and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals
 And that's in stark contrast to the taken-for-granted water supplies that we regularly drink all the time
 This is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built on the Santa Ana River in Southern California
Now, you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater is some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done
 So there's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses
So, let's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years
On our planet, where there's water, there's life
 The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet
 That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue
 The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice
 There's another contradiction -- that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars, and that light, that energy, heats the ice
Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere
Thank you
 And of course that's a highly competitive space
 Then you have a top two percent show
-- which should tell you enough about what's going on on that end of the curve
" So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here, the bulge of average TV, you know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad, they don't really get you excited
 So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this
 He needs a guaranteed success, and so what he does is, he holds a competition
What they don't realize is that, while they're watching their shows, actually, they are being watched
 You guys know the show?
 
1 rating on this curve, so it's exactly where they wanted it to be
Now, the question of course is, what happened here? So you have two very competitive, data-savvy companies
 So why? Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time
And if data analysis does not work that way, then it actually gets a little scary, because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV
 OK, so Multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software, because if you do, it means you're in prison
In 2009, Google announced that they were able, with data analysis, to predict outbreaks of influenza, the nasty kind of flu, by doing data analysis on their Google searches
 And it worked beautifully, and it made a big splash in the news, including the pinnacle of scientific success: a publication in the journal "Nature
And now the crucial thing is that data and data analysis is only good for the first part
 There's another tool that can do that, and we all have it, and that tool is the brain
 If there's one thing a brain is good at, it's taking bits and pieces back together again, even when you have incomplete information, and coming to a good conclusion, especially if it's the brain of an expert
 Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show, which also meant, by the way, that they were taking a pretty big personal risk with that decision
 And Amazon, on the other hand, they did it the wrong way around
So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions
 This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball, and it's really amazing, because if you have a decision to make, a yes or no question, all you have to do is you shake the ball, and then you get an answer -- "Most Likely" -- right here in this window in real time
Now, the thing is, of course -- so I've made some decisions in my life where, in hindsight, I should have just listened to the ball
 But, you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis to come to a better decision
 And I find that a very encouraging message, in fact, that even in the face of huge amounts of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you're doing and take risks
A hundred years ago this month, a 36-year-old Albert Einstein stood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin to present a radical new theory of space, time and gravity: the general theory of relativity
 A hundred years on, we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics, but what's at stake now is rather different
 The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature, or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science, we could be facing questions that we cannot answer, not because we don't have the brains or technology, but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it
This is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting
 It should be dark, lethal and lifeless
 It's all around us right now
 Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings, a bit like a light switch
 Now, if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out how strong dark energy should be, you get an absolutely astonishing result
 This number is bigger than any number in astronomy
 In fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics, and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity
So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic way of looking at the world, but it has one catastrophic problem
 What if all of these 10 to the 500 different possible universes actually exist out there somewhere in some grand multiverse? Suddenly we can understand the weirdly fine-tuned values of these two dangerous numbers
 If we follow this line of thinking, then we will never be able to answer the question, "Why is there something rather than nothing?" In most of the multiverse, there is nothing, and we live in one of the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something
 Despite high hopes for the first run of the LHC, what we were looking for there -- we were looking for new theories of physics: supersymmetry or large extra dimensions that could explain this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field
 But despite high hopes, the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely Higgs boson
The stakes now could not be higher
But if, in two or three years' time, when the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown, we've found nothing but the Higgs boson, then we may be entering a new era in physics: an era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain; an era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse that lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach; an era where we will never be able to answer the question, "Why is there something rather than nothing?"
It sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that
 So building a machine like the LHC requires countries from all over the world to pool their resources
 No one nation can afford to build a machine this large, apart from maybe China, because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources, manpower and money to build machines like this
Studies like this are exceedingly rare
 About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s
 And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men
 They were given medical exams
 Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that journey in the opposite direction
 We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns
 It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer
 And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline
 What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way
So what about you? Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60
But in the end, the results always blow my mind
 As new reefs form, a new world literally starts to evolve, a world that continuously amazes me
Sponges look like veins across the faces
 Tunicates explode from the faces
And the amazing response we've had to these works tells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal, because it seems that these images translate across the world, and that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist and about what I'm trying to achieve
 And I think this is for a reason, or at least I hope it is
 The subsequent international media forced the local government to pledge 10 million dollars in coastal cleanups
 If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel, we'd all go crazy
 And its waters are where frat boys can ride around on Jet Skis and banana boats
Because for me, this is just the beginning of the mission
Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city, and you've never seen the ocean
 And this is because, in the digital age of conflict, there exists a feedback loop where new technologies, platforms like the ones I mentioned, and more disruptive ones, can be adapted, learned, and deployed by individuals and organizations faster than governments can react
 It took until 2011, when it came at the end, where other things, like West African drug trafficking, took precedence
We all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks
 The divide between physical and digital domains today ceases to exist, where we have offline attacks like those in Paris appropriated for online hacks
 We see online radicalization of teens, who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks
 They severed her head, put it on top of her computer with a similar note
" And escalating that conflict, Los Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people for every bit of information you release
 Individuals have more power than ever before to affect national and international security
But we still can't ignore government, because that's who we turn to for collective action to keep us safe and secure
" "Cyber 9/11 is imminent
 And government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin mean giving up control, but it means that developers, translators, anybody with an Internet connection, in countries like Cuba, Iran and China, can sell their skills, their products, in the global marketplace, but more importantly sell their ideas, show us what's happening in their own countries
 And there have been reactions of two different kinds: welcoming parties and border fences
 But I think what surprised many people is it's not only sudden, but it wasn't supposed to be sudden
 You have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya, for example, and yet Europe looked totally unprepared
 It looks enormous, but the population of the European Union is 550 million people, which means we are talking about one per every 2,000 Europeans
 They are the three countries that are, in the end, receiving the refugees
 The rest of Europe is looking without doing much
 I'll try to ask them, make them blunt
" I remind you of one thing: in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis, I remember one minister saying, "Turkey will be able to receive up to 100,000 people
 And the idea is that nobody is taking care of it -- this is happening without any kind of management
 And so their idea was, "They are coming to my village
 But there are villages in Germany with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees
Now we see some problems with the Syrian situation, as the Syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis, but the truth is that for a large period, all borders in the Middle East were open
 So I would say that even today, the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open
 But that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people
 And here we have a basic review of the criteria, the objectives, the priorities of development cooperation that is required
For instance, Lebanon and Jordan are middle-income countries
 Because they are middle-income countries, they cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank
 They have millions of refugees there, and to be honest, they are pillars of stability in the region, with all the difficulties they face, and the first line of defense of our collective security
 So it doesn't make sense that these countries are not a first priority in development cooperation policies
 And, of course, if you look at today's situation of the indicators in these countries, it is clear that, especially their poor groups of the population, are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing
 It's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest more massively in support to these countries
 We need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today, in protracted situations, at a certain moment, that it doesn't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid and development aid or development processes
 Because you are talking about children in school, you are talking about health, you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded
 I quote: "I am calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US, until our country's representatives can figure out what's going on
 We have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying, for instance, that Muslims refugees should not be received
 Because what you are saying --
 Have the recent attacks in Paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult?
And my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism
 I think, as I said, essentially terrorism in Europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing, and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong, by welcoming and integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world
 At that time, we had had, recently, some conflicts that were solved
 It is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was
 If you had to write such a note to your successor, Filippo Grandi, what would you write?
 So I was thinking about female friendship a lot, and by the way, these two women, I'm very honored to say, have been my friends for a very long time, too
 He said, "You can tell a lot about someone," in this case a woman, "by the company that she keeps
 You're taking up our time
 So tell me, what do you look for in a friend?
 You know, I was thinking this morning, I don't even know what I would do without my women friends
 And most of them are a good deal younger than me, too
 I'm approaching -- I'll be there sooner than you
 I'm showing you the way
 Well, you are and you have
 I read a lot so, as Lily knows all too well, my books that I like, I send to my friends
 When we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women, female friendships, and I was so surprised to see how many books, how much research has been done recently --
 Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized
 Which is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone
 Which is also increased when we're with our women friends
 If you know what I mean
 I think we all know what you mean
 What are the differences, in your opinion, between men friendships and women friendships?
that they don't have what we have
I have a lot of compassion for men, because women, no kidding, we -- women's relationships, our friendships are full disclosure, we go deep
 We risk vulnerability -- this is something men don't do
 They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls, or talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex
 They don't ask for help
 That's a Gloria Steinem quote
 And we've got to make something different happen
 It's because our friendships -- female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood, and sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world -- to make it what it should be -- the things that humans desperately need
And we need to do it soon
 We are the ones that need to get off the grid
 You know, that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet, and that's not true
And wait, no, here's the best part
 The planet needs women
 We are not even in the Constitution
Thank you
 Thank you both
 There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors, and they start at around 3,900 pounds
Now, this is a real proposition, and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment, but my interest in it is quite different
 And those white shapes that you can see, they're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city
 We wanted to show that, even though death and burial are things that we might not think about, they're all around us, and they're important parts of our cities
 Traditionally, it's been done by private and religious organizations, like churches and mosques and synagogues
 They had a load of ideas
 And then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no
 But what if I've got a piece of land and I just want to bury a few people, like five or six? Well, then -- actually, I don't need permission from anyone! There's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial, and the little bit that there is, is about not polluting water courses, like not polluting rivers or groundwater
But I mean, like -- really, who does this? Right? Well, if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate, then there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it, and you'll bury your family there
So what if you wanted to try this yourself at home? Well, there's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you
 But that's pretty much it for formal requirements
So what I find fascinating about this is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death
 In the UK, and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar, only about 30 percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around death, and even for people over 75, only 45 percent of people have ever talked about this
 Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them, blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us
Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity
 2014 was the hottest year on record
 Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades
 These planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course
 You could say that I look for choice alien real estate
 Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best: those of our own Solar System
 Our rovers, like Curiosity, crawl across its surface, scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it
  
 They're just closer to home
So when I was a kid 
 It was like literally having your roster devastated
 Ordinary people, the way they looked at seafood was like this
 It's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements
 But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry, and you'll see four: turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese
So it makes sense that we've headed in this direction
 In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University, it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find
 Those are the things that hold soil together, protect coasts, create habitats for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp, all sorts of things that are important to this environment
 Well, this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests
 We've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves over the last 30 or 40 years
" This phenomenon is very, very relevant to anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef
The next most consumed seafood in America, and also throughout the West, is tuna
 The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it, "The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas
" Of course we've seen incredible improvement in ICCAT in the last few years, there is total room for improvement, but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish, and to manage it, we have to manage the globe
 Now salmon got its plundering, too, but it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing
" So it's a national epidemic, it's an international epidemic
 When they first started farming salmon, it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon
And it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to, we're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs
 So I often wonder, is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish? It's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing
 So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich actually started as halibut
" Ray Kroc said, "I don't think it's going to work
 I want to do a Hula Burger, and there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun
 It's actually a tremendously sustainable solution, it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months
 It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s that we all think are going to make us live forever
So what do we do? I mean, first of all, what about this poor fish, the clupeids? The fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons
 Microalgae make the omega-3s, they're only bioconcentrated in fish
 We could look at a vegetable
 Every time I do a new story, somebody tells me, "We can do all that
 It is time to scale this up
So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with
Thank you
 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
 Y'all like that? Let me show you how we used to do it --
 when I was growing up in the '90s
 OK, he's trying to battle me
 Hold on, right now, hold on
 Do you remember when you used to beatbox me to sleep?
 I remember that
 What you would have is that, when we would go to parties, you would have the DJ and you would have the rapper
 You know, in church, we'll look at each other like,
 Sorry? I can't hear you
 Thank you, everybody!
 The worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers, it's pretty scary
97 percent of pathogens near the outlets
 And so how, essentially, this works is you would start out with these 2D drawings -- these are floating around in technical papers around the Internet
The first thing I thought was, "This is no good
So how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material into these existing spots that are already in the plane
So you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again, but this time, we're able to effectively push that down to the filters for elimination
 When we take a look at what this means, what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes, but also if the window-seat passenger sneezes or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes
 But now, we're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right away
 One day, I was invited to an important event, and I wanted to wear something special and new for it
 So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer, and I loaded the file on the printer
 It just printed the pieces overnight
 The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing, and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks
So I decided to move on to working with big machines, ones that didn't fit in my living room
 But I had a few issues with them
 They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable
With 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted, but still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio
 I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship
 So what is a filament? Filament is the material you feed the printer with
 For example, your name or your sweetheart's name
 Yeah!
 Cool!
 And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is
 In fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections, in the liminal space, where by liminal I mean the space in-between
Beyond the physical landscape of our planet, some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections
I've lived the entirety of my life in the in-between, in the liminal space between dreams and reality, race and gender, poverty and plenty, science and society
I am also an astrophysicist
 I study blazars, supermassive, hyperactive black holes that sit at the centers of massive galaxies and shoot out jets nearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light in a process we are still trying to completely understand
I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart
 The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists
 It was striking to me because it featured a young black girl, probably around 12 years old, looking studiously at some physics equations
 I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal copy of the poster, which to this day still hangs in my office
After receiving my master's at Fisk, I went on to Yale to complete my PhD
 Williams at UC Hastings reported facing racialized gender bias, including being mistaken for the janitorial staff
 Engineering requires the application of basic science and math to the lived experience
 Technology sits firmly on the foundation of math, engineering and science
Secondly, among the most pressing issues of our time, most now find their intersection with STEM
 We as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity
 Alexander said it this way: "I'm used to walking between two cultures
 Alexander and Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories, the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race, gender and innovation
I am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM who are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time: things like educational inequities, police brutality, HIV/AIDS, climate change, genetic editing, artificial intelligence and Mars exploration
 10 seconds
 [123 meters]
 That dive you just watched is a journey -- a journey between two breaths
So, we start with the last breath
   As you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense
 When I leave the surface, I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs
 The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop
 This mechanism is innate
 When they dive deep into the ocean, these mechanisms become activated, but to a greater extent
Right as I leave the surface, nature gives me a push in the right direction, allowing me to descend with confidence
 The free fall phase is the best part of the dive
 I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters without making a single movement
 It's truly an amazing feeling -- an extraordinary feeling of freedom
 40 meters down, 50 meters down, and between 50 and 60 meters, a second physiological response kicks in
 If you try that underwater, you might tear your lungs, spit up blood, develop an edema and you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time
 At this point, my body receives this information, and my lungs start relaxing
And the dive continues
 And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol -- you all know him as the hero in "The Big Blue" -- came along and dived down to 100 meters
 And in a way, it's all thanks to him, because he challenged known facts, and with a sweep of his hand, got rid of the theoretical beliefs and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves
 He showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt
 Close your eyes
 The surface is far, far away
 There's hardly any light
 It's cold -- freezing cold
Although, you'd agree, I should be worried
 And each time, I picture the same image
 It's extraordinary
 I belong up there, on the surface
 First, because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom
 It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood, which causes confusion between the conscious and unconscious mind
 You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to -- you have to let it happen
 Around 60, 70 meters, you start to feel the need to breathe
 When that happens, you think, "Where's the surface? I want to go up
 I look at the rope right in front of me, leading me back to the surface
 Time goes faster this way
 Five meters below the surface, I start to breathe out, so that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in
And in return, my lungs open up
So, the journey I've just described to you is a more extreme version of free diving
 Luckily, it's far from just that
 For the past few years, I've been trying to show another side of free diving, because the media mainly talks about competitions and records
 But free diving is more than just that
I'd like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing, you'll realize that when you stop breathing, you stop thinking, too
 Being able to free dive lets you, just for a moment, relax your mind
 Holding your breath underwater means giving yourself the chance to experience weightlessness
 We breathe with our first breath at birth, up until our last one
 Holding your breath in the sea, not necessarily at 100 meters, but maybe at two or three, putting on your goggles, a pair of flippers, means you can go see another world, another universe, completely magical
 That's largely true
 This is me rock climbing for the first time
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident
 For example, one of my challenges was textbooks
  I think they tried to stay away from me
 I don't blame them
 I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone
 Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks, by using personal computers and mobile devices, in Braille or in voice
 And this is actually not the first time this happened, because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation
 Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities
 I could even search for any information by myself
OK, now let me show you the latest technologies
 The door is on your right
 Nick is approaching
 Where are you going? You look so happy
  CA: Oh 
 Now 
 And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social
 It will become my best buddy, and yours
 As a country, we are sending millions of women back to work every year, incredibly and kind of horrifically soon after they give birth
 I'm just going to show you two of them
 I didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door, because now, total strangers from all walks of life write to me all the time just to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work within days or weeks of having a baby
I've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye because then we'd be horrified, and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it
I want to break this choice thing down into two parts
 Today in America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce, and in 40 percent of American households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner
 I didn't make you have a baby
 The babies that women, many of them working women, are having today, will one day fill our workforce, protect our shores, make up our tax base
OK, this is pop quiz time: what percentage of working women in America do you think have no access to paid maternity leave? 88 percent
 "We adopted our son
 When I got the call, the day he was born, I had to take off work
These corporate stock photos hide another reality, another layer
 A nurse told me, "I didn't qualify for short-term disability because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition
 One of my coworkers was only able to afford 10 days off with her baby
"
Of course, this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications
 I promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day, I'd make up at night from home
 I thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this
So those are the mothers
 But those things are hidden behind images like this
"
 If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first, we might stick with one kid
86
I'm here today with only one idea worth spreading, and you've guessed what it is
 I am done, done having babies, and you might be pre-baby, you might be post-baby, you might be no baby
 We have to stop framing this as a mother's issue, or even a women's issue
 We need to question why we're told that this can't work when we see it work everywhere all over the world
 We need to recognize that this American reality is to our dishonor and to our peril
What was the most difficult job you ever did? Was it working in the sun? Was it working to provide food for a family or a community? Was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property? Was it working alone or working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed, but that might improve human health or save a life? Was it working to build something, create something, make a work of art? Was it work for which you were never sure you were fully understood or appreciated? The people in our communities who do these jobs deserve our attention, our love and our deepest support
But people aren't the only ones in our communities who do these difficult jobs
 The molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs
 And after this storm took off half of its tissue, it became infested with algae, the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died
 Whether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure, that phrase bothers me, because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades
So let's change that
 At the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva -- a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed, but with all of the sensory systems that we have
 Here's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue, about to release them into the seawater
 We collected this, we got it back to the lab, we got it to fertilize and we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab
 We are limited by the space on our bench, the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour
 And here you see one embryo dividing, alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize and will blow up
So never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars
 Coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi
Thank you so much
The beginning of this performance was easy
 But very soon after, there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes, and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach
 The women would tell the men what to do
 And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening, and it was all public, and they were with their wives
 started walking towards the public
 I was a mess
 The audience and the performer make the piece together
 In the theater, the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup
 And here I met Ulay, and he was the person I actually fell in love with
 You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets, I exchange into love and trust
 So, heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on, is about trust, is about total trust to another human being
Our relationship was 12 years, and we worked on so many subjects, both male and female energy
 We walked, each of us, three months, two and a half thousand kilometers
" The curator said to me, "That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York, this chair will be empty, nobody has time to sit in front of you
But I sit for three months
 This performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago -- nothing would have happened
 Because thinking about immateriality, performance is time-based art
 And then after this is performance, and then everything else
 If you want to get experience, you have to give me your time
 But it's six hours, the experience
This is orientation hall
 It's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter
 After this, you're going to the magnet chamber, where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body
 And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished -- or counting sand in the desert
 I think failure is important because if you go, if you experiment, you can fail
 And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes
 The applications start rolling in, and the qualified candidates are identified
 Person A: Ivy League, 4
0, flawless resume, great recommendations
 So I ask you: who are you going to pick?
 We call A "the Silver Spoon," the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success
 And we call B "the Scrapper," the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the same point
A resume tells a story
To be clear, I don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon; getting into and graduating from an elite university takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice
 A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered, which scientists call Post Traumatic Growth
 So, every day he came home from the factory, took a nap, studied until 4am, went back to work and repeated this cycle every day for three months
"
So back to my original question
 Who are you going to bet on: Silver Spoon or Scrapper? I say choose the underestimated contender, whose secret weapons are passion and purpose
 And so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel, short story collection or memoir from every country in the world
 And so I did
I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able to get books in English from every country
 Only around 4
 Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books, I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world
 I explained who I was, how narrow my reading had been, and I asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what I might read from other parts of the planet
 At first, it was friends and colleagues
But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year
 From Sweden to Palau, writers and translators sent me self-published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers or that were no longer available, giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds
 I read, for example, about the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance against the Portuguese in the 19th century; and about marriage rituals in a remote village on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan
 But, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook for Portuguese speakers, I had more people than I could involve in the project, including Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field, who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago
 With my nine volunteers in place, I managed to find a book by a São Toméan author that I could buy enough copies of online
 That can be an uncomfortable experience, particularly if you're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own
 And it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world
 It's the story of the power books have to connect us across political, geographical, cultural, social, religious divides
 I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come
 And in this surreal, otherworldly place, it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth, or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend
 But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind, of the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought, about what it means to be human
 Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate -- in particular, using graphic or written forms of communication
 And while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time, what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication
 And with its invention, it became possible for the first time for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time
Over the last century, more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent, decorated with animals, abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily
 Before I could even get started on my questions, my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites
 Now, if these were random doodles or decorations, we would expect to see a lot more variation, but instead what we find are the same signs repeating across both space and time
 Some signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing, while other signs are later inventions
 We might not know what they meant, but the people of the time certainly did
I'm not talking about writing yet
 And that even 5,000 years ago, people were already building on something much older, with its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years -- to the geometric signs of Ice Age Europe and far beyond, to that point, deep in our collective history, when someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark, and forever changed the nature of how we communicate
But why is the question always do they love us? Why is it always about us? Why are we such narcissists? I found a different question to ask animals
There are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind
 I think there are several ways in
The first thing to remember is: our brain is inherited
 Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates
 The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates
 But it's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same in a crayfish, a bird or you
Octopuses use tools, as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces
 If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain, what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain
 It's a good thing ours is bigger, because we're also really insecure
 They're obviously very concerned about something
 What are they concerned about? It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes, elephants will ignore it, because tourists never bother elephants
 Whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa or outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same
 We are kin under the skin
 Empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions
Empathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life, comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration
Then there's something that I call sympathy, a little more removed: "I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away
 But we don't treat our own kind too well either
 When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me -- not to the couch, to me -- and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly, she has had the thought, "I would like my belly rubbed
 He'll get the job done, and it will feel good
But we see other animals and we say, "Oh look, killer whales, wolves, elephants: that's not how they see it
"
 This is him four days later
 And now their range is shattered into little shards
 In Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf
 But in the park, park rangers did that in the 1920s, and then 60 years later they had to bring them back, because the elk numbers had gotten out of control
And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves
 A pack is a family
 And then, when they wandered just outside the border, two of their adults were killed, including the mother, which we sometimes call the alpha female
 The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family
We cause so much pain to them
 When human beings use one thing to represent another, we call that art
 But love is not the thing that makes us human
 If that stops, it all goes away
 This is an albatross six months old, ready to fledge -- died, packed with red cigarette lighters
 We paint animals on the walls
 And every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark, deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now, and their flood is us
 Usually not more than two kilometers in width
 With the rising sea, they say, "Well, you can move back
 So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there
 I think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future
 And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone, and this is connected, yes? What happened here?
 We create them, and then we send them either north or south
But they aren't supposed to come back
 It's a new experience
 Well, I've been telling this story every year
 We have a plan, we think we have a plan
 These people are looking for solutions
 The Japanese are interested in building floating islands
 We don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared to do so
 Of course, our culture is very different, our society is very different, and once we migrate into a different environment, a different culture, there's a whole lot of adjustments that are required
 There was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island, and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands
 I was very angry, very frustrated and then depressed
 We don't have a lot of livestock, so it's fish that we depend on
 And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners, tuna resource owners
 And at the moment, we have been getting something like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue from access fees, license fees
 National revenue, which drives everything that we do in governments, hospitals, schools and what have you
 And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that
 Another reason why I did that was because I had been asking the international community that in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change, there has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment
 Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations? Because you're up against companies that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, essentially
 And we only get about 10 percent
 In order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved
 Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate because for us, it's about the future of these children
 I have 12 grandchildren, at least
And I think I have eight children
 It's about their future
 And so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today
Mr
 I've worked in print
 So five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope with using virtual reality and journalism together
So here's the real line
 We need an ambulance
 Now, when you're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds, and you see the injured around you, it's an incredibly scary and real feeling
 We were then invited to take the piece to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London
 There was no press about it, so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights
 But a lot of people tried it, and over a five-day run we ended up with 54 pages of guest book comments, and we were told by the curators there that they'd never seen such an outpouring
 And it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are -- it's really evocative
 Right?
 I have to really follow best journalistic practices and make sure that these powerful stories are built with integrity
 And interestingly, we broke some news with this story
 I've had Americans tell me that they've donated, direct deductions from their bank account, money to go to Syrian children refugees
 First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it
Yes
In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes
That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt
 In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1
 And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead
 In the pantheon of great collections, mine doesn't even register
I'm a very typical 37-year-old sneakerhead
 And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry
 At the asset level, he can see gain-loss by shoe
 And that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists
 And while that definitely happens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe
 In the case of sneakers, that someone is Nike
2 billion
 Just complete domination
 That means that sneakerheads made 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year
The sneaker market is just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using supply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit
 So it's really just supply
 Sneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it
 And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people with life-long passions, myself included
 For 15 years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO every single weekend
 You know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often
 There are very few -- if any -- legal, unregulated markets of this size
But that means no efficiencies, no transparency, sometimes not even authenticity
or have earned 162 percent on your money -- double the S&P and 20 percent more than Apple
Thank you
 I was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq
Of course, I was supposed to be writing an article, but that's how it always goes -- you're supposed to be writing and something big happens
 Suddenly, there was a huge explosion
 I walked into a room and realized that it had been hit by a missile
 And when I turned him over, I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis, but I couldn't see anything, nothing at all
 We put him in a car that took him to the hospital
 As soon as the car left, I went back
 And then, the war was over
 He ended up working as a croupier in a Beirut casino where I later found him, because he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job
 It was something that existed, but that we never spoke about
So having that image of horror in your brain, seeing the void of death -- that analogue of horror which is hiding something -- will completely take over
 You cannot do anything, anything at all
 You cannot work anymore, you cannot love anymore
 You want to be loved, but you hate everyone
 It's a feeling that seizes you entirely day in and day out, and you suffer tremendously
 And no one understands
"
 So you see, this relates to everything, not just modern warfare, but also ancient wars -- you can read about it, the evidence is there
 Because these people feel excluded from humanity
 They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed
 The psychiatrist asked, "Why are you in this state?" And the man said, "Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away
 They've lost their lightness
 So this means that if we manage to look death in the face, and actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide, like some of the men or women I know did, such as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo and other people I know, like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer, who gave up field assignments after a trauma
 I played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself
 I grew up in an enormously traditional family
 My father's actually a religious leader in the community
 You get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol, you don't smoke, you always do service, you're a good kid
 Some of the rules we had were strict, but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed
 I was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children when they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor, having sinned
 I was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay
 So that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead, and I accepted without question that women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth, which we call the priesthood
 And I faced this contradiction in myself, and I joined with other activists in my community
The next thing we did was build advocacy organizations
 We lost standing in our community
 Most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council, and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better, because we believed that they could be
 When I hear these arguments, I still continue to bristle, because I have family and friends
 How do we respect someone's religious beliefs while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others? It's a tough question
 The way that we've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear
 Women are now allowed to pray in our church-wide meetings, and they never were before in the general conferences
It wasn't easy standing in those lines trying to get into those male meetings
 There were hundreds of us, and one by one, when we got to the door, we were told, "I'm sorry, this meeting is just for men," and we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting as young as 12 years old, escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line
 I'm working on my people
 What are you doing for yours?
 I will show you why that, philosophically, is almost an impossibility
But let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget
But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like, "Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict?" You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore, you're looking for knowledge, which is something way more complicated and delicate
Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign, where people set out to insult her through her search results
 And that picture was published all over
 This is July 22 in 2011, and a terrible day in Norwegian history
And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps, that he did two things: he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids
 It's not true
 He blew up those buildings, he shot those kids, and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him
And if there was somebody who immediately understood this, it was a Swedish web developer, a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist
 And he told everybody, "If there's something that this guy wants right now, it's to control the image of himself
 They did not step in and manually clean those search results up
 You're true, you're false
" That's power if I ever saw it
 You need to identify your own personal bias
If I had grown up in Taiwan, or any place outside of the West, would I have found models of happy, thriving LGBT people?
 As an HIV social worker in San Francisco, I had met many gay immigrants
"
These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world
 They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be
 There was just one problem
 Despite widespread poverty, a decade-long civil war, and now recently, a devastating earthquake, Nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality
 But, in 2007, Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization successfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court to protect against LGBT discrimination
 What I'm most proud of? I'm a transgendered person
 On December 21, 2007, the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same-sex marriage
 This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am
 On one hand, India is a Hindu society, without a tradition of homophobia
 On the other hand, it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system, which rejects anything that threatens the male-female order
 Whether we are gay, we are lesbian, we are transgender, bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from, we have to all unite and fight for our rights
 While getting my hair cut, the woman cutting my hair asked me, "Do you have a husband?" Now, this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling
 In Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria
 David wasn't ashamed of who he was
 Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive than here in the US
 Welcome gays to Shanghai!
 Turns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all
 And let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today
 But there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world
 One year after returning home from our trip, marriage equality came to California
 By the power vested in me, by the state of California and by God Almighty, I now pronounce you spouses for life
And you may wonder, what's the point? And the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" -- tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet
 We have shown in the lab that we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell
 And this is faster than most broadband connections these days
 And this instrument shows something at the moment
 This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light
 But in order to prove the point, I can block the light of the solar cell
 This means, despite the blockage, there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition video
This is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth
I have dedicated the past 20 years of my life to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil, and it has been absolutely amazing
 They're massive
But what is it that a conservationist does? Well, first, we need data
 And then we can gather information about how they use space, how they move through the landscape, what are their priority habitats, and so much more
 We have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are
 Never
 This is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world, an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America
 This camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it
 When you drive around and you find dead tapirs along the highways and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn't be, and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes because their families poach and eat them, it really breaks your heart
The situation in the Cerrado made me realize -- it gave me the sense of urgency
 We have to find ways to solve all these problems
 We'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now
 For now, this is just a crazy idea
 I am not alone
 These animals deserve to be cared for
 They need us
Every day, I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives, across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas
It was a Saturday morning when the call came, and they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach
 There were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet
Day two on the water, they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea
 I fear the boat is going to sink
" And Bassem said to her, "Please be patient
 Bassem was a good swimmer, so he held her hand and tread water
 Around 100 people survived initially, and they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue
 I'm too weak
" And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa, and they perched her onto the life ring
 Her older sister Sandra had just drowned, and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter
 I will not survive
" And then she went away and drowned
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water, who couldn't swim, found herself in charge of two little baby kids
 When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned, she said to the sobbing child, "She just went away to find you water and food
" But his heart soon stopped, and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water
 And she said, "Please, God, let them rescue me
 She was really dehydrated
 The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them, and the Greek nurses never left her side, holding her, hugging her, singing her words
" And it had this photo
 She wants to reunite with her family there
 She wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice
 what if she didn't have to take that risk? Why did she have to go through all that? Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe? Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden? Why couldn't Bassem have found work? Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees, the victims of the worst war of our times? The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s
 And I understand the public fears
So on behalf of little Masa and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those 500 people who drowned with them, can we make sure that they did not die in vain? Could we be inspired by what happened, and take a stand for a world in which every life matters?
 So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year, things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries, or making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound
 And we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain
 And we don't get the word "like" or "um" or hyperventilating or crying
 I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me
" As a mom that one just -- The next message comes a month later
 Thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression -- huge
 So how do we use the data to make us better? Alright, chances are someone here, someone watching this has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life -- you do not have to raise your hand
 Think about it: those 6
 The worst time of day for substance abuse: 5am
 And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there, because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation
And we've made this data public and free and open
Data, evidence makes policy, research, journalism, policing, school boards -- everything better
 I think of myself as a national health activist
 I get really excited about this data, I'm a little nerdy
 I want to use it to help that girl, who texted in about being raped by her father
 And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys
And I started wondering, are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things from happening? Or at least if bad things happen, will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe
 Whenever there's a disaster, a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right? Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained, you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem
 Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious
 If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there when you look for them
 Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol
 And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position, where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision
 But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts
 And so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin
"
 Now, what is this, the NNT? It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped
 So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin, what do you suppose it is? How many people have to take it before one person is helped? 300
 I ran through the numbers myself
 Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway
 That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped
 And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients
 And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two
 And I have to admit, I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted, and piles of emails that I haven't gone through
Thank you very much
 We are used to invitations, but this invitation really thrilled us
 The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special
 No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats
The government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag -- Germany's parliament -- and the Brandenburg Gate, and right next to the gate there are other embassies, in particular the US and the British Embassy
 The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there
 Over the last couple of years, we learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy, the secret services have been listening to the entire district, including the mobile phone of Angela Merkel
If people are spying on us, it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying
 Our installation was therefore perfectly legal, and the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it
 Text messages, voice chat, file sharing -- anything could be sent anonymously

If we become aware of the constellation, the terms and conditions of communication, it not only broadens our horizon, it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview, our specific social, political or aesthetic conventions
 We were searching for an interface and we found one
" Together with Roma families, we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe, for example, in Freiburg in Germany, in Montreuil near Paris, and also in the Balkans
 But they aren't a commercial enterprise
 On the floor, a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center, accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility
 Several revisited the exhibition
 It was a powerful experience
 And allow them to talk as well
 Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol
 French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s, and as time went by, mixed with local signs, it evolved into the language we know today as ASL
 Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all
 You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound
 At the same time, I've learned that I create sound, and I've seen how people respond to me
"Don't burp, and when you're eating, make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate
 TBC, to be continued
 Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural
 That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artist residency there
 During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces, and as I went from one place to the next, I noticed there was no visual art there
 there was no visual art, everything was auditory
 And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork, or it could empower me
There's a massive culture around spoken language
 ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters
 If just one of those keys were to change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning
 The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume
Oh -- busted
"
 So, the first example is "a long time ago
" Then "past," "used to" and the last one, which is my favorite, with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it, "once upon a time
"Common time" is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure
 Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest, kind of like "common time" or at the same time
International [Sign], as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world
 And now this
 And again
 This is "enlightenment" in ASL
 But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible
 And it doesn't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash
 So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop
 And so we started building this small workbench, with different heights, so even really short kids can participate
 And so, back to plastic
 So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots, kids get very excited
And we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there -- and this is the image that we get in the robot
But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids
 And also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown, so when everything is mixed up, it's really hard to see what's in the water
 So what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help, remotely, other kids
So I'm half Japanese and half French, and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan
 It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves -- they are called tsunami -- and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan
So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident, and I measure independently and with other scientists, on land, in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids
 And to do this, we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant
5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant, and with the help of the local fisherman, we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built
 And so I wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things
And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small, so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong, and we turned it into the largest mega-space focused on social and environmental impact
 Another son, Ryan, is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen, and the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining
 They think nothing of calling social services to try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out
 This shows 30 years of intervention in that family's life
"
 I want to know what's going on and what we can do differently
 Because not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family in a way that makes a difference
 So Tom, who is the social worker for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan, has to spend 86 percent of his time servicing the system: meetings with colleagues, filling out forms, more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms, and maybe most shockingly, the 14 percent of the time he has to be with Ryan is spent getting data and information for the system
" And the mothers say, "Thank you
 But today, she's completed an IT training course, she has her first paid job, her children are back in school, and the neighbors, who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them, are fine
 The contemporaries of William Beveridge, who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the Beveridge Report, had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man
 They led to longer lifespans, the eradication of mass disease, mass housing, almost universal education
 I went shopping, I played bingo, but mainly I was just observing and listening
 It's relationships that are making the difference
I've talked about the first two factors
 But here, too, the systems are failing
 And so the response has been to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional -- to speed up processing times, divide people into ever-smaller categories, try and target services at them more efficiently -- in other words, the very opposite of relational
 Maybe some of you here this evening are thinking, "But I found my job through an advert," but if you think back, it was probably a friend that showed you the ad and then encouraged you to apply
So knowing this, and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems, we designed something new with relationships at its heart
Thank you
I would like to invite you to come along on a visit to a dark continent
 However, we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth
However, since systematic cave exploration started about one century ago, we know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world
Caves form in karstic regions
 However, I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars to explore alien worlds
 But soon, the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet, searching for new potential entrances of this undiscovered continent
 And they are, really, a lost world
 They are surrounded by up to 1,000-meter-high walls, resembling a fortress, impregnable by humans
These mountains contain also a scientific paradox: They are made by quartz, which is a very common mineral on the earth's crust, and the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite, and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth
So we did several attempts to reach this area, by land and with a helicopter, but it was really difficult because -- you have to imagine that these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year, by fog
 And only in 2013 we finally landed on the spot and we started the exploration of the cave
 However, there were legends about the existence of a cave in the mountain
 So when we started the exploration, we had to explore with a great respect, both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people, but also because it was really a sacred place, because no human had entered there before
 So we had to use special protocols to not contaminate the environment with our presence, and we tried also to share with the community, with the indigenous community, our discoveries
 The time needed for their formation could be as long as 50 or even 100 million years, which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth
 Because what seems a simple stalactite here is not made by calcium carbonate, but is made by opal, and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed
Anyway, actually, we know that this kind of formation, after several studies, we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms
 They are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures resembling stromatolites
 And, really, everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the mineralogical world
 So as we explore this dark continent and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and uniqueness, we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet and on the relationship and evolution of life in relationship with the mineral world
 Thank you, Francesco
 It's always dark
 Yeah!
 You can even keep the shutter open for one minute and then paint the environment
 You spray the environment with light and that's what you get
 And you probably think you're addicted to your phone, but you're really not
 They're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture, and also in senses -- things that can turn dumb objects, like cups, and imbue them with the magic of the Internet, potentially turning this digital cloud into something we might touch and move
The parents in crisis over screen time need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read, as well as family-safe app stores
Reality is richer than screens
 For example, I love books
 So what makes this a richer experience than a screen? I mean, scientifically
 But there's more than you can do with these magic boxes
Next I worked with the Japanese agency, AQ, on a research project into mental health
 This object captures your touch, so you might press it very hard if you're angry, or stroke it if you're calm
 It's like a digital emoji stick
 Our friends at Tellart in Boston brought over a pair of street binoculars, the kind you might find on the Empire State Building, and they fitted them with 360-degree views of other iconic world heritage sights --
 So, they became this very physical, simple reappropriation, or like a portal to these other icons
 So you might see Versailles or Shackleton's Hut
 The CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes to the DNA in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease
Part of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas9, that's able to seek out, cut and eventually degrade viral DNA in a specific way
 And it was through our research to understand the activity of this protein, Cas9, that we realized that we could harness its function as a genetic engineering technology -- a way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells with incredible precision -- that would offer opportunities to do things that really haven't been possible in the past
The CRISPR technology has already been used to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys, other organisms as well
When viruses infect a cell, they inject their DNA
 CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
 And importantly, those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny, so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation, but over many generations of cells
So those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus associate -- they bind -- to protein called Cas9, which is white in the picture, and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell
 It makes a very precise break
 Imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties, such as stronger bones, or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable, like a different eye color or to be taller, things like that
 Genome-engineered animals and plants are happening right now
 Your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine is incredibly responsible
 It's interesting that as I talk to people, my scientific colleagues as well as others, there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this
" So that's kind of the other school of thought, that we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it
 Well, I think with any new technology, especially something like this, there are going to be a variety of viewpoints, and I think that's perfectly understandable
" I think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts
 It's easy to simply ignore them and it's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden
 But unlike Gitmo they exist right here, at home, floating within larger federal prisons
There are 2 CMUs
 Neither of them underwent the formal review process that is required by law when they were opened
 Some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence
 Rafil Dhafir, who violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by sending medical supplies for the children there
" "Told him no
 I had even learned through the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit, that they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs, like this one
 So how could I possibly be approved to visit? A few days before I went out to the prison, I got an answer
 The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs as "self-contained housing units
 There was a grapefruit-sized orb in the ceiling for the visit to be live-monitored by the Counterterrorism Unit in West Virginia
 We did our best to find reasons to laugh
For the record, I'm not
 But I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward are terrorist code names
 Three months after our visit, McGowan was transferred out of the CMU and then, without warning, he was sent back again
 I had published leaked CMU documents on my website and the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife and asked her to mail them
 He wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined, "Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech
"
Now, I know all of this may be hard to believe, that it's happening right now, and in the United States
 Their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls
 It is about us
 When I was in high school, I learned about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, freedom of speech, due process and about 25 other laws and rights that seem to be violated by this
 I think the solution to any of these types of situations, any rights abuses, are really dependent on two things
 And unfortunately with these prisoners, one, people don't know what's happening at all and then they're already disenfranchised populations who don't have access to attorneys, not native English speakers
 In some of these cases, they have great representation that I mentioned, but there's just not a public awareness of what's happening
 And I could easily tell you that I was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that I grew up with, by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors, or by the 1980s pop on my childhood radio stations
I'm going to start today with nature, but before we do that, let's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up
 That is the sound of a bird slowed down to a pace that the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own
 One by one, these birds became his teachers
 And we have so many examples of this: the Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments to the pitches of the birds in the forest around them
 Musician and natural soundscape expert Bernie Krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low, medium and high-frequency bands, in exactly the same way as a symphony does
So let's go now to the uniquely human world of language
 And I find this distilled most clearly in what I like to call emphatic language -- language that's meant to highlight or underline or that springs from surprise
 But when I was a kid, this was my very favorite word, and I think it's because it has a pitch
Or take, for example, the phrase for "It is right" or "It is correct" -- "Lickih nehu 
 And I like to write bass lines, so they both ended up kind of as bass lines
 It was from them and from Amhariña that I learned that we are awash in musical expression with every word, every sentence that we speak, every word, every sentence that we receive
 The musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score, which was actually purchased by the Museum of Modern Art -- the score, that is
 The world is alive with musical expression
 I thought, "What a weird, cool swing that cooking pan lid has
 He was saying that on its own, the environment is musically generative, that it is generous, that it is fertile, that we are already immersed
 And he has a theory that it is possible -- it is possible -- that the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music, because it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone
 But there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong
 So the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration, look no further than your tires, as they roll over the unusual grooves of the freeway, or the top-right burner of your stove and that strange way that it clicks as it is preparing to light
 We are the audience and we are the composers and we take from these pieces we are given
 Nothing
 A couple of months earlier, they had found a body, in an identical wetsuit, and they had no idea who this person was
 So they were then able to tell that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time, October 7, 2014, in the French city of Calais by the English Channel
We heard this story, and it triggered me and my colleague, photographer Tomm Christiansen, and we of course had the obvious question: who were these people? At the time, I'd barely heard about Calais, but it took about two or three seconds to figure out Calais is basically known for two things
 But if you just fled the war in Syria, and your family, if you have any family left, don't necessarily know where you are, and you're staying here illegally amongst thousands of others who come and go every day
 It is a story about the fact that everybody has a name, everybody has a story, everybody is someone
So this is where we started our search
 And after a while, we heard this story about a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England, and had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months
 And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz was October 7, 2014
 That was the same date the wetsuits were bought
In Turkey, he's not accepted at a university, and once he had left Jordan as a refugee, he was not allowed to reenter
 He was a working kind of guy
 They've been bombed by the military, they've been besieged, they've been stormed by ISIS and they've been cut off from supplies for years
So Shadi and one of his sisters, they fled to Libya
 He fell completely in love with the ocean, so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya, late August 2014, he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy
" His cousin, of course, tried to warn him not to, but Shadi's battery on the phone went flat, and his phone was never switched on again
 This is Tomm Christiansen, who took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together
 It was after the publication of the article
 They had a difficult time, but they were positive, they had hope
 Yes
 That's an editor taking responsibility
 And we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing are based upon evidence -- evidence that's designed to help us
 However, the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone
 How many other things need to be analyzed by gender? What else are we missing?
 It was cheaper
" And this stayed this way until about the 1980s, when this concept was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies we actually did them a disservice, in that apart from reproductive issues, virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient
Since that time, an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way
 You know, we have this saying in medicine: children are not just little adults
 And we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults
 This area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks
 Heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women, but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men
And so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these differences? If we look at the anatomy, the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men, and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different in women compared to men
 In how many life-saving areas of medicine, like cancer and stroke, are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing? Or even, why is it that some people get those runny noses more than others, or why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes work in some and not in others?
 Gender is how someone presents themselves in society
 But it's important to realize that from the moment of conception, every cell in our bodies -- skin, hair, heart and lungs -- contains our own unique DNA, and that DNA contains the chromosomes that determine whether we become male or female, man or woman
 Page from the Whitehead Institute, who works on the Y chromosome, and Doctor Yang from UCLA, they have found evidence that tells us that those sex-determining chromosomes that are in every cell in our bodies continue to remain active for our entire lives and could be what's responsible for the differences we see in the dosing of drugs, or why there are differences between men and women in the susceptibility and severity of diseases
 Right now
 We have programs for the doctors, for the nurses, for the students and for the patients
 It's essentially changing the way we think about medicine and health and research
 It's changing our relationship to the health care system
 But there's no going back
Martin Luther King, Jr
 This awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women
 Remember, for me and my colleagues in this field, your sex and gender matter
 It detects features from the environment, and it determines where it is relative to those features, using a method of triangulation
But the main point I want to convey to you is that these robots are capable of building high-resolution maps at five centimeters resolution, allowing somebody who is outside the lab, or outside the building to deploy these without actually going inside, and trying to infer what happens inside the building
Now there's one problem with robots like this
 Because it's big, it's heavy
 That drives up the cost of this robot
So this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf, and all you need is an app that you can download from our app store
 And you can see this robot reading the letters, "TED" in this case, looking at the corners of the "T" and the "E" and then triangulating off of that, flying autonomously
In this case, this is a Philly cheesesteak hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air
 In another experiment, I want to show you how the robot adapts its flight to control its suspended payload, whose length is actually larger than the width of the window
 But of course we want to make these even smaller, and we're inspired in particular by honeybees
 And it can travel up to six meters per second
 These are going at a relative speed of two meters per second, and this illustrates the basic principle
 In my lab, as we developed these robots, we start off with these big robots and then now we're down to these small robots
 So from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms
 It's aware of the fact that it needs to form the circular shape, but collaborating with its neighbors it forms the shape without central coordination
 And these shapes can be varying as a function of time, and you'll see these robots start from a circular formation, change into a rectangular formation, stretch into a straight line, back into an ellipse
So why work with swarms? Let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in
 And that's mostly because of water shortage, crop diseases, climate change and a couple of other things
 On the left-center is an infrared camera
 And on the main panel, you're seeing a three-dimensional reconstruction of every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees
 The first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple: count the number of fruits on every tree
 This is easily discernible from imagery, not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery
 But robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard
 In the last few days, the leaders of the world, meeting at the UN in New York, agreed a new set of Global Goals for the development of the world to 2030
 And here they are: these goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise
 The Global Goals are who we, humanity, want to be
Did we hit this target? Well, no, we didn't
 This year, global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent
But that ain't easy, because the Global Goals aren't just ambitious, they're also pretty complicated
 Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets and literally hundreds of indicators
 Also, while some of the goals are pretty specific -- end hunger -- others are a lot vaguer -- promote peaceful and tolerant societies
 What this does is measures all the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve, but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time
The Social Progress Index basically asks three fundamental questions about a society
 In concrete terms, that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today
 So there's our target, 75 out of 100
 And what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth and social progress
 Higher is better
 And what this tells us is that as we get richer, social progress does tend to improve
 And now we can use this information to start building our forecast
 So here we are today, $14,000 per capita GDP
 How rich are we going to be in 2030? That's what we need to know next
4
 And also, we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits
 There are costs to the environment, costs from new health problems like obesity
What that tells us, quite simply, is that GDP is not destiny
 Costa Rica has prioritized education, health and environmental sustainability, and as a result, it's achieving a very high level of social progress, despite only having a rather modest GDP
 What if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica in prioritizing human well-being, using its wealth for the well-being of its citizens? Well then, we get to nearly 73, very close to the Global Goals
 It grades our performance on the Global Goals on a scale from F to A, where F is humanity at its worst, and A is humanity at its best
 Now the new Global Goals are explicitly universal
 They ask for every country to show action and to show progress
 It's about every country
If I wait for you longer
But I was just thinking and thinking, merely thinking
 I was just thinking
that I'm tired of calling you once a week
 This song is called "Home," and it's sort of a "This is where I'm from, nice to meet you all," kind of song
Home is a song I've always remembered
No matter where I may roam
I'm always gonna find my way back home
No matter how far I’m gone
Home is flowers in a windowsill
Home is the taste of an apple pie
And she said home is where you’re born and raised
And I met a man, he sat looking out to the sea
And she said all my life I’ve been trying
I’m always gonna feel at home
 And this is especially new and true for spatial recognition -- so like, how you navigate your way in the city
 But moreover, if you just block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant
How about stress? Yes, stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus
 And now, you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage
 So here we have a sample of diet -- of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy
 So next time you are at a dinner party, you might want to reach for this possibly "neurogenesis-neutral" drink
 But this diet has also been given to human participants, and what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis, such as: calorie restriction will improve memory capacity, whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression -- as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids, which increase neurogenesis, and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression
 We also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of Robert's patients
 Fantastic research, Sandrine
 Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much
Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble, he saw a figure struggling to be free
 And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate
 Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions
 Our back skins are thicker, with small pores
 So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view, the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the chisel and the gene, between machine and organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt -- this was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen -- like a second skin that are made of a single part, stiff at the contours, flexible around the waist
But is nature ideal? Are there no parts in nature? I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible, and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about
" For this first fruit tree, there was to be no differentiation between trunk, branches, leaves and fruit
 The whole tree was a fruit
 Instead, the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers
 The land created a world made of parts
So we looked for that biblical material, that fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material, and we found it
 The second-most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin, and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shrimps, crabs, scorpions and butterflies
 We thought if we could tune its properties, we could generate structures that are multifunctional out of a single part
 By varying chemical concentrations, we were able to achieve a wide array of properties -- from dark, stiff and opaque, to light, soft and transparent
 The robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these 12-foot-long structures made of a single material, 100 percent recyclable
 When the parts are ready, they're left to dry and find a form naturally upon contact with air
 They've been here, engineered for the first time, to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing
 Where we wanted more photosynthesis, we would design more transparent channels
 And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED -- our first photosynthetic wearable, liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing
 It does so by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations
 However, when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch, not inside a box, we realized it would spin a flat cocoon and it would still healthily metamorphisize
Silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons, their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry
 We knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas, so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure
 We ordered 6,500 silkworms from an online silk farm
 In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the Silk Road
 One spins silk out of a robotic arm, the other fills in the gaps
 Which brings us back, of course, to the beginning
 Here's to a new age of design, a new age of creation, that takes us from a nature-inspired design to a design-inspired nature, and that demands of us for the first time that we mother nature
Thank you
I want to talk to you about the future of medicine
 In fact, the model is so simple that you could summarize it in six words: have disease, take pill, kill something
 In other words, 0
 In fact, the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards, not downwards, but upwards, and we begin with a self-regulating, semi-autonomous unit called a cell
 We've tried to kill cells using a variety of chemotherapies or targeted therapies, and as most of us know, that's worked
And finally there's the level of the environment, isn't there? You know, we don't think of cancer as altering the environment
 There are attempts to create milieus, change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer, for instance
Or take another disease, like depression
 My right knee was swollen up, and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone
 And I had an MRI the next week, and it looked like that
 85 percent of all women by the age of 70 would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration
 So this is a very common disease
 Well, the second perk of being a physician is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments
 Nothing happened
And so Dan suggested to me, "You know, maybe it isn't a mechanical problem
 Number one, there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell -- a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton, bone, cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton, just like there's a stem cell in blood, just like there's a stem cell in the nervous system
 You know, in biology, it's location, location, location
 This is a little bone, a mouse bone that we fractured and then let it heal by itself
 Could we implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing? Could your medicine be an organ that's created outside the body and then implanted into the body? Could that stop some of the degeneration? What if the organ needed to have memory? In cases of diseases of the nervous system some of those organs had memory
 I began this talk with models
 But perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's: mechanisms, models, metaphors
 So, if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way, we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies, and then personalizing organ or organismal therapies, and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment
 CA: So converted to stem cells, perhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something, and prepared
 This is what's happening, and in fact, we're slowly moving, not away from genomics, but incorporating genomics into what we call multi-order, semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems, like cells, like organs, like environments
 But if we do that, we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future
 If we focus in on a shorter period of time from 1950, we have established in 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, then rolling on a few years, in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord, where it established avoiding a two-degree temperature rise in keeping with the science and on the basis of equity
 And all the way through, during all of these meetings and many others as well, emissions have continued to rise
 Now imagine that same day -- but it's six, eight, maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer on that day during that heat wave
 That's the kind of thing we're going to experience under a four-degree global average temperature scenario
And the problem with these extremes, and not just the temperature extremes, but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts, is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events
 This will be absolutely devastating for global food security
 Is it reasonable still to focus on the two-degree path? There are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists who would say that it's now too late to avoid a two-degree warming
 But we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to do it
 Some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century, maybe much longer
 So this poses really big challenges for us
 If you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high, it points us towards reducing energy demand
 And that's because with all the will in the world, the large-scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system is just simply not going to happen in time
 So because it's the area under the curve that matters, we need to focus on energy efficiency, but also on energy conservation -- in other words, using less energy
So that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations
 And this applies to all of us, whatever sphere of influence we have
 Because we really need to make significant change
 I am wondering what's your take on the cut by 70 percent for 2070
 Yeah, it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees
 One of the things that often -- when there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do, is they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world can start to reduce emissions
Any anxiety at all
I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
 Maybe you've heard of us
 But then I would discover something new and totally different, and I would dive into that
 The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career
 I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything

 You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea, such as polymath, the Renaissance person
 I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community, we cannot agree on a single identity

 I've had a lot of time to think
For the first 12 years of my life, I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy
 Then everything changed
 I contracted a brain infection
 The doctors weren't sure what it was, but they treated me the best they could
 I would never talk to a friend
 I felt worthless
 I lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again
 I taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were
 Someone they were kind to and cared for
 An aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week
But as I began to communicate more, I realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for myself
 My body was slowly getting stronger
 I remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work, thinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to
 However, after all I had been through, I still couldn't shake the belief that nobody could truly see beyond my disability and accept me for who I am
I also really struggled to comprehend that I was a man
 All this is how the world knows who we are
 It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this
 The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light
 But if you will, please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can:
Thank you
 And in the Southeast, there's an alarming disconnect between the public and the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place
Now the majority of us aren't going to willingly go way down to a swamp
 So how can we still expect those same people to then advocate on behalf of their protection? We can't
So my job, then, is to use photography as a communication tool, to help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics, to get people talking, to get them thinking, and to hopefully, ultimately, get them caring
I started doing this 15 years ago right here in Gainesville, right here in my backyard
So it became assumed, then, that the only good swamp was a drained swamp
But now we're backpedaling, because the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes, the more secrets we're starting to unlock about interspecies relationships and the connectivity of habitats, watersheds and flyways
 That's nuts
This is a narrative that's all too commonly unraveling here in this state
 And this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years and we're just now learning about it
Growing up here in North Central Florida, it always had these enchanted names, places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee, Corkscrew, Big Cypress
 And when I say Everglades, most people are like, "Oh, yeah, the national park
" But the Everglades is not just a park; it's an entire watershed, starting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north, and then as the rains would fall in the summer, these downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward, ever slowly, with the topography, and get into the river of grass, the Sawgrass Prairies, before meting into the cypress slews, until going further south into the mangrove swamps, and then finally -- finally -- reaching Florida Bay, the emerald gem of the Everglades, the great estuary, the 850 square-mile estuary
But I'll show you these beautiful pictures, because it gets you on board
 This is the Everglade snail kite
 And then they've gone down to about 400 nesting pairs today
So as we started damming up the Everglades, as we started diking Lake Okeechobee and draining the wetlands, we lost the habitat for the snail
 And I spent months planning this crazy idea
  After setting up the platform, I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails
 Then we banned the plume trade, and their numbers started rebounding
 What they found out is that these birds started nesting in the winter as the water drew down, because they're tactile feeders, so they have to touch whatever they eat
 And we're down to less than 70 nesting pairs in Florida Bay today, because we've disrupted the system so much
 It is resilient
 Show the state that protecting wilderness not only makes ecological sense, but economic sense as well
 And we use these parks and these natural areas as beacons and as cultural compasses
But I'm encouraged, because maybe we're finally starting to come around, because what was once deemed this swampy wasteland, today is a World Heritage site
" Whenever I heard this opening sentence, no matter the country that concluded it -- England, America, Ghana, Nigeria -- I thought, "But that's not true

 Speaking with Colum McCann that day, the penny finally dropped
 "I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage
 "I'm a local
 Despite my pride in Ewe culture, the Black Stars, and my love of Ghanaian food, I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana, writ large
 These are the places that shape my experience
What if we asked, instead of "Where are you from?" -- "Where are you a local?" This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are
 Tell me you're from France, and I see what, a set of clichés? Adichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France? Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris, better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see a set of experiences
 I call these the three "R’s": rituals, relationships, restrictions
 "R" number one, rituals
 My mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston, my best friends in New York: these relationships are home for me
We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships, but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions
 A very different picture of your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge
 Udo studied in Buenos Aires, and nine years ago came to Berlin
 He loves going to Argentina -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the economic corruption there
Of course, when we ask, "Where are you from?" we're using a kind of shorthand
 Geography, tradition, collective memory: these things are important
 More power
Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them
 In creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity
 The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories
 In fact, all of us are multi -- multi-local, multi-layered

I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade
 So I think about this all the time
 The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer
 There are spots on the paper that are sticky
 And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside

 So these are healthy worms, and you can see they're moving around normally
 These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules sticking together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer's

A question I'm often asked is, where did I get my passion for human rights and justice? It started early
I came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer, and I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers
" And then I explored what was behind that; it was about changes in the climate -- climate shocks, changes in the weather
 But, in recent years, at the time of this conversation, they had nothing but long periods of drought, and then flash flooding, and then more drought
Indeed, I was very struck about the situation in Malawi in January of this year
 I think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly
And that brought me then to climate justice
 Climate justice responds to the moral argument -- both sides of the moral argument -- to address climate change
 So they must develop without emissions, and that is a different kind of problem
 This is an issue that requires complete human solidarity
 In Costa Rica, they have committed to being carbon-neutral by 2021
 But wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory, and be part of the community of nations? That is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about
I was very conscious of this as I took part this year in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 1945
 1945 was an extraordinary year
 And they had to build structures for peace and security
 And what did we get? What did they achieve? The Charter of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, as they're called, The World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund
 And the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on January 1, 2016
 The climate agreement -- a binding climate agreement -- is needed because of the scientific evidence that we're on a trajectory for about a four-degree world and we have to change course to stay below two degrees
The reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the United Nations
That's what I felt
 And I have five grandchildren now, I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother to have five grandchildren, and I think about their world, and what it will be like when they will share that world with about 9 billion other people in 2050
For the last year, everyone's been watching the same show, and I'm not talking about "Game of Thrones," but a horrifying, real-life drama that's proved too fascinating to turn off
 A similar poll taken in the United States in November 2014 found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos, and a further 23 percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown
 When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl, Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded, those videos were shown during the Iraq War
 The Berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week, and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of May, runner-up only to "American Idol
" The al-Qaeda-linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site
That day, the first film of a public beheading was created in France
 Several still photographs were taken as well, and you can still watch the film online today and look at the photographs
 If we take a bigger leap back in history, we'll see that for as long as there have been public judicial executions and beheadings, there have been the crowds to see them
 In London, as late as the early 19th century, there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging
 The blade fell, the head fell into a basket, out of sight immediately, and they called out, "Give me back my gallows, give me back my wooden gallows
Today, a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable, but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious about thinking that things are different now and we don't behave like that anymore
 Today, the action takes place in a distant time and place, which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening, a sense of separation
 Today, we are all offered front row seats
 Our activities online are often contrasted with real life, as though the things we do online are somehow less real
All these things make it easier as an Internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death, to push our personal boundaries, to test our sense of shock, to explore our sense of shock
 History tells us we won't, and the killers know it too
 Thank you
 I used to work at a museum called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America
 People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head museum, the shrunken head museum!" And at the time, I was working on the history of scientific collections of skulls
 I was working on the cranial collections, and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory, primitive, savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing, and all the while these vast -- I mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums, all across Europe and the States -- were kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality

 At that time, she said, "OK, you go next time, and you will help them
 You will help them
 So I took them to the mosque, and to make a long story short, I told them I'd give them teachers
 Today, they are the best trainers
 They learn English, they learn how to be teachers, they learn computers, and they are my guides
 And --
 We cannot only train women but forget about the men, because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time
 So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential, and all of this is going to happen
I want to share this with you, because of love, because of compassion, and because of trust and honesty
 He said that by having compassion and having love, you can conquer the world
 And I tell you, we could
Thank you very, very much
 Thank you
 And within about two months, I noticed at about 10am every morning I had this strange urge to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer
 Within two weeks, I was out of there, and I left with one intention: to find something that I could screw up
And I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone: it turns out that over 80 percent of the people around don't enjoy their work
So I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work, and I read books and did case studies, 300 books altogether on purpose and career and all this, totally just self-immersion, really for the selfish reason of -- I wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do, what that was for me
 I was proud of this, and it wasn't that I had any special magic
" And I realized that so many people around us are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb, and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall, or no wall at all
 I mean, you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set than you do you picking your major and your area of study
0 is a book and also an online tool
 I highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at
 Every day, every week, every month of every year I spend some time just reflecting on what went right, what went wrong, and what do I want to repeat, what can I apply more to my life
 Write down what it is about them that inspires you
It's kind of like in Wall Street 2, if anybody saw that, the peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO, "What's your number? Everyone's got a number, where if they make this money, they'll leave it all
 I'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water
 I don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear ever since they watched Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times when I was a kid
 I'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate
 Think how you would have approached your world differently if at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half in 56-degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco
 And he's just flailing like this
 All of a sudden, two parents run up and grab him, and they put him on their shoulders, and they're dragging him like this, totally limp
You prove people wrong, you prove yourself wrong, that you can make little incremental pushes of what you believe is possible
 "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with
 They change everything, and it's a proven fact
 And those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that I dreamed of for Live Your Legend so many years back
The people change everything, and this is why -- you know, you ask what was going on
 And then I'm over here in San Francisco, and everyone around me was doing it
 And without even trying, your standards go from here to here
 You don't need to change your goals
 Because this is the group of people that inspires possibility
And the thing is, people are waking up to this possibility, that really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination
 It's just about doing something that matters to you, and makes an impact that only you can make
"
 And it's what is the work you can't not do? Discover that, live it, not just for you, but for everybody around you, because that is what starts to change the world
Thank you guys
" And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer
As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along
Number 30, I really like this one: Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things you might not say to someone you just met
 But then we did, and --
So the week before the article came out, I was very nervous
 And by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called
 I did radio interviews and they asked
I understand that this is part of the deal
 But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response
 I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together
 My own relationship was only a few months old, and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place
 What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them? If the answer was no, would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions any less worthwhile? Dr
" Sounds romantic, doesn't it? But the study did work
 The participants did feel closer after doing it, and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and a student came up to me afterwards and he said, kind of shyly, "So, I tried your study, and it didn't work
" He seemed a little mystified by this
"
I first came across this study when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult breakup
 What I want from love is a guarantee, not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow, but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely
But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love
 We're in love because we each made the choice to be
 I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice, and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me
I'm here to recruit men to support gender equality
Now, I wasn't always a middle class white man
 It all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in graduate school, and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day, and we said, you know, there's an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory, but there's no courses yet
 We'll read a text, we'll talk about it, we'll have a potluck dinner
So every week, 11 women and me got together
 It was a conversation between two women
 To me, race is visible
 You don't see it
 Privilege is invisible to those who have it
" It is a luxury, I will say to the white people sitting in this room, not to have to think about race every split second of our lives
 You know, I'm a middle class white man
"
 I had to start thinking about them, and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long
All that semester, whenever my colleague opened her mouth, what my students saw was a woman
Disembodied Western rationality
 I was on a TV talk show opposite four white men
So, now I've established some of the obstacles to engaging men, but why should we support gender equality? Of course, it's fair, it's right and it's just
A man and his son are driving on the freeway, and they're in a terrible accident, and the father is killed, and the son is brought to the hospital emergency room, and as they're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room, the emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says, "Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son
 We could not figure this out
 So I decided I would pose this riddle to them, just to see, to gauge the level of change
 Well, 16-year-old boys, they immediately turned to me and said, "It's his mom
 
 They want to be involved fathers
Because here's what the data show: when men share housework and childcare, their children do better in school
 Their children have lower rates of absenteeism, higher rates of achievement
 They are less likely to see a child psychiatrist
 Their wives are less likely to see a therapist, less likely to be diagnosed with depression, less likely to be put on medication, more likely to go to the gym, report higher levels of marital satisfaction
"Housework Makes Her Horny
 "
" These data were collected over a really long period of time
 It's not a win-lose
 It is a win-win for everyone
 We know this
 And my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live
Up in the left-hand corner is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha
 Child care is expensive, more than they'd earn in a job
  It's awesome, right?
 A little extra money in their pockets to make them feel some independence
 And Brianna is doing fantastic -- she's doing great academically and socially
 And that's sammich -- not sandwich
 I see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas, so that they can create a better life for themselves, their families, their communities
 I was bussed to a school in the suburbs, from a neighborhood that many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous
 Not as good as a buttermilk drop
 Marginalized communities are full of smart, talented people, hustling and working and innovating, just like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs
 Hard work is the common denominator in this equation, and I'm tired of the story we tell that hard work leads to success, because that allows --
 A whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief that if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them, we should give them lots and lots and lots of money
 How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha really all that different from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world? Baakir has experience and a track record
 I'd put my money on him
So, consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy
 Let's grasp this opportunity to let go of a tired, faulty narrative and listen and look for true stories, more beautifully complex stories, about who marginalized people and families and communities are
 Let us remember what we are capable of; all that we have built with blood, sweat and dreams; all the cogs that keep turning; and the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work
" Listen to Suheir Hammad recite "First Writing Since," or Esperanza Spalding perform "Black Gold
 Look at the hands of your grandmother or into the eyes of someone who loves you
 Individually, we don't have a lot of wealth and power, but collectively, we are unstoppable
Thank you
What I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear and the cost of fear and the age of fear from which we are now emerging
Please, applaud that
And yet, despite the fact that we lived for 50 years with the threat of such a war, the response of our government and of our society was to do wonderful things
 But sometimes it can produce an un-constructive response
 There were just a few thousand terrorists
 We launched two wars
S
 Everybody has the same worldview, and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat
 You also have processes that become reactive to news cycles
S
 In fact, the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms
 If you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago -- it said that 80 percent of the people on the planet, by the year 2020, would have a smartphone
 We are within years of a profound moment in our history, when effectively every single human being on the planet is going to be part of a man-made system for the first time, able to touch anyone else -- touch them for good, touch them for ill
 We don't have the basic ideas formulated
 It's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent
 In my cell phone, I have an app that tells me where every plane in the world is, and its altitude, and its speed, and what kind of aircraft it is, and where it's going and where it's landing
But it doesn't just affect the security side
 How government services are delivered is changing in the same way
 But what you had was a partnership and a dialogue, and the dialogue has broken down
 It's broken down because in Washington, less government is considered more
But we have a government that doesn't want to listen, that doesn't have people at the highest levels that understand this
 They were expected to know the lingo, the vocabulary
S
 Where are the philosophers? Where's the dialogue?
And that brings me to the reason that I'm here
 Pity me
The dialogue isn't happening there
 Both sides need each other
 Were you feeling that?
 First of all, Bobby Riggs -- he was the former number one player, he wasn't just some hacker, by the way
 And I thought, "If I lose, it's going to put women back 50 years, at least
 But every generation has the chance to make it better
 That was really on my mind
 Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know, which a lot of people probably don't, said that any federal funds given to a high school, college or university, either public or private, had to -- finally -- give equal monies to boys and girls
So you can have a law, but it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it
 That's when it really rocks, totally
 Some women have waited 10, 15 years to ask
 And for women, there are generations who have also experienced teamwork
 And tennis is global
 That's who I truly am, just fighting for people
 And I think if you can see it you can be it, you know? If you can see it, you can be it
 Now with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, you're taking on an even bigger cause
 Isn't it great? Look at the technology! It's amazing how it connects us all! It's about connection
 And then you see a gay guy who has an NFL -- which means American football for all of you out there, it's a big deal, it's very macho -- and he talked about football all the time, because he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know
 Even being gay I catch myself, you know, like,
 And that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims, and this is the second time in my entire life
 So Deloitte sent out a survey, and over 4,000 people now have answered, and we're continuing in the workplace
 They just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking, and get into the solution
 What did the research show you about millennials? Are they going to make a difference? Are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force?
 I want to stay in the now with the young people, I don't want to get behind
 I don't think there's any chance! But what you found out in the research about millennials is not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials
"
 Now Billie, that story -- I know, but that's what scares the boomers -- I'm just telling you -- so I think it's good for us to share
No, it is good for us to share, because we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling, so we've got to take it both ways, you know? But I have great faith because -- if you've been in sports like I have -- every generation gets better
 That's very important to us
 And I want to hear from people
 And you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected
 And it is amazing
And we drove them crazy because we pushed, we pushed because we wanted to be the best
 And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson, who's a former president -- Thank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!
 OK? You don't have to agree with somebody, but everyone has the opportunity
 Everyone matters
 And every one of you is an influencer
 OK? So don't ever give up on yourself
 For me, it just took 11,000 volts
 It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead
 I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides
Now, on the systems side, on the other hand, so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented
 It is not limited to hospice
 So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care
 He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV
 Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another
 It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world beyond our control
 Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time
 Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower
 now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective
 Anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body with flower petals
 They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness
Now mind you -- I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane
 I spent a few months in a burn unit at St
 Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey, where I got really great care at every turn, including good palliative care for my pain
 There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness, and into ever older age
 And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami
 I know we can because we have to
 Little things aren't so little
 Take Janette
 Priorities change
 So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the very thing doing the living and the dying
Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all
 Beneficence
 But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation
 Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human
 The need for food has birthed cuisine
 And if we're lucky, it might even be important
 And in general, I think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do
 When we say of somebody that he's "in it for the money," we are not just being descriptive
In addition to creating things, science creates ideas
 If you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy, you shrink into despair
And there's something special about idea technology, that makes it different from the technology of things
 With things, if the technology sucks, it just vanishes, right? Bad technology disappears
The thing about science -- natural science -- is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos, and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories
 It's going to work the same damn way no matter what theories we have about the cosmos
Thank you
 It was a four-minute and 27-second descent
 So in scuba diving, you have a self-contained system
 You have a scuba tank
 So the system weighs about 500 pounds, and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere, they used a capsule
 Again, this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second, and I want to play you a video of the actual launch
 You can see the balloon up there
 There's the balloon going by, fully inflated at this point
 He was my wingman on the descent
 But the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea, and it was a roll that looks like that, but watch what happens when I pull it out
 It's forming a pipe
So nothing is possible without an amazing team of people
 The core of this was about 20 people that worked on this for the three years, and they were incredible
 People asked me what the best part of this whole thing was, and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and environmental systems and high altitude medicine
 My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old, she and I were in the car, and we were driving down the road, and she was sitting there, and she had this idea, and she goes, "Dad, I've got this idea
" And she looks at me and she goes, "Dad, after what you just did, how can you call anything impossible?" And I laughed, and I said, "OK, it's not impossible, it's just very, very hard
 You had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age
 And they had a very good policy, because you could do half your time at your own mathematics, and at least half your time working on their stuff
 So, I went there
 You were a code-cracker
 And I didn't like that war, I thought it was stupid
 OK
 Chern was one of the great mathematicians of the century
 I had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley
 How about explaining this?
 And about 10 years after the paper came out, a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory and people in Russia started applying it to what's called "condensed matter
 We didn't know any physics
 This is so incredible
 Somehow, you come up with a mathematical theory, not knowing any physics, discover two decades later that it's being applied to profoundly describe the actual physical world
But there's a famous physicist named [Eugene] Wigner, and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics
 Somehow, this mathematics, which is rooted in the real world in some sense -- we learn to count, measure, everyone would do that -- and then it flourishes on its own
 [Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry, and Einstein realized, "Hey! It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity
 It is a mystery
 And it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics: algebraic topology, geometry
 So, here's this thing: it has eight vertices, 12 edges, six faces
 And vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two
 And in fact, you could do this any which way -- cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles and mix them up
 So, this is called the Euler characteristic
 Let's talk about Renaissance
 Because you took that amazing mind and having been a code-cracker at the NSA, you started to become a code-cracker in the financial industry
 The way it's been explained to me, what's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns, it's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk, compared with other hedge funds
 I started trading and it went very well
 It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling
 I look at that, and I say, "That's just a random, up-and-down walk -- maybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time
 You'd make money, you'd lose money, you'd make money
 But this is a year's worth of days, and you'd make a little money during that period
 Trend-following would have been great in the '60s, and it was sort of OK in the '70s
 By the '80s, it wasn't
 I didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading
 But some of it was money
 But they also came because it would be fun
 You look at a lot of data, and you try to simulate different predictive schemes, until you get better and better at it
 So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected
 What sort of things?
 Everything is grist for the mill -- except hem lengths
 You can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time -- the probability of it being random is not high
 So you have to keep on top of the business
 I think in the last three or four years, hedge funds have not done especially well
 The stock market has been on a roll, going up as everybody knows, and price-earnings ratios have grown
 We charged the highest fees in the world at one time
 We made good returns, yes
 I don't think we should worry about it too much
 It's reduced volatility
 So I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund
 This is your wife, Marilyn
 You're working on philanthropic issues together
 Well, Marilyn started -- there she is up there, my beautiful wife -- she started the foundation about 20 years ago
 She kept the books, and so on
 We did not have a vision at that time, but gradually a vision emerged -- which was to focus on math and science, to focus on basic research
 Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation
 How did we get here? Well, there are two questions: One is, what is the route from geology to biology -- how did we get here? And the other question is, what did we start with? What material, if any, did we have to work with on this route? Those are two very, very interesting questions
 The first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA or something like that -- how did that all work? And the other, what do we have to work with? Well, more than we think
 Now, every year in our Milky Way, which has 100 billion stars, about two new stars are created
 That one is somewhere along this settling-down period
 But here's the thing -- in this dust that surrounds a forming star have been found, now, significant organic molecules
 Well, math certainly works
 And it does this by encrypting your IP address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software
 You can use it on the normal Internet, but it's also your key to the dark net
 It is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users
 You will find political activism blogs
 But let's say for a moment that you were
 There is even, most beautifully of all, a "Report this item" button
You browse through the site, you make your choice, you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin, you enter an address -- preferably not your home address -- and you wait for your product to arrive in the post, which it nearly always does
 And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption
And this introduction of competition and choice does exactly what the economists would predict
"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote, via the internal emailing system that's also encrypted, of course
"Hi there, thanks for your email
 Starting small is a wise thing to do
 And the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation -- by the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect; the site that I showed you was shut down 18 months ago, but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade
 But these markets, because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating, the inhospitable conditions, are always innovating, always thinking of ways of getting smarter, more decentralized, harder to censor, and more customer-friendly
But at the beginning of these sites, people noticed a flaw
 Some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin before they'd mailed the drugs out
But then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin, because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger
It's incredible
 Ethereum, which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world, to create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls
 Now, we've had distributed computing before, of course
 And I think that's what's going to happen
 That's good news if you care about liberty
 It's not one side or the other that's going to win out, but both
Thank you very much, indeed
As she handed me my porridge, I asked her why she was there, and without hesitation, she said, "As Africans, we must uplift all the people of Africa
" I had absolutely no idea what she meant
But her words stuck with me
 Every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family
Imagine a blank page with one horizontal line splitting it in half
 In our current population, HeForShe is about moving the 3
In fact, men don't care, we were told
But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe
 Two weeks ago, I was listening to my radio, and your voice came on, and you spoke about something called the HeForShe, and the need for men to play their role
 Madam, it has been two weeks, and the woman has not cried since
Already, a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete HeForShe commitments
 We are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life, and from every single corner in the world, from the United Nations' own Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Secretary-Generals of NATO and the EU Council, from the prime minister of Bhutan to the president of Sierra Leone
In Europe alone, all the male EU Commissioners and the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments have signed up to be HeForShe
Now this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has for the world that we want to see
 It's kind of a magic place, the mountain
 It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology
 And so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos
 There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; it's called the James Webb Telescope, and it will be launched in 2018
 There'll be a satellite called TESS that will discover planets outside of our solar system
 And as we've learned over the centuries, since Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist, first turned, in that time, a two-inch, very small telescope, to the sky, every time we have built larger telescopes, we have learned something about the universe; we've made discoveries, without exception
You got it
And one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars
 There are 500 of those that are multiple-planet systems
 They come in a bewildering variety of different kinds
So, what is the GMT project? It's an international project
 And if we were --
 It's tens of millions of light-years away
 This is what this cluster would look like
 And now finally -- and look how dramatic this is -- this is what the GMT will see
 This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth, and this, again, what the GMT will see
 And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade, with all seven mirrors
 We'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail
 Thank you, Wendy
 You mentioned different facilities
 So the Magellan Telescope is going up, but also ALMA and others in Chile and elsewhere, including in Hawaii
 In terms of the science, they're very complementary
 The telescopes that are in space, the telescopes on the ground, telescopes with different wavelength capability, telescopes even that are similar, but different instruments -- they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking
 So when we discover other planets, we'll be able to test those observations, we'll be able to measure the atmospheres, be able to look in space with very high resolution
So this is serious
 From '83 to '95: two percent per annum
 Everywhere in public services -- in companies, in the way we work, the way we innovate, invest -- try to learn to work better
 One, the one I prefer, is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math
 They are the favorite team to win
 Notably, if you compare them to an average team, say, the French team,
2 meters ahead of the French team
4 meters ahead of the French team, based on the data
 So, there are 3
5 billion women on earth
 So what happened? The fastest team did not win; the slower one did
 We need more clarity, we need to clarify the roles, the processes
 And we will have at least two like that
 So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague
Now, let's look at the race in slow motion, and concentrate on the third runner
 That makes a difference in whose legs? In the legs of the next runner
 But when the next runner runs super-fast, is it because she made a super effort, or because of the way the third runner passed the baton? There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer
 It is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers, to build advantage on a global scale, to create value
 This is what is killing productivity, what makes people suffer at work
 They have turned against human efforts
 Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not, if, when they cooperate, they are individually worse off? Why would they cooperate? When we blame personalities instead of the clarity, the accountability, the measurement, we add injustice to ineffectiveness
We need to create organizations in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate
 Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness
 These are the UAVs
 Fantastic for structural engineers
 That fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in, and it was going to take the divers two weeks
 And a great example of that is Bujold
 The only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement, you have to go through things that are on fire
 It was so hot, on one of the robots, the tracks began to melt and come off
 The biggest problem is the data, the informatics, because these people need to get the right data at the right time
 So we need to think about those kinds of challenges
 Everybody can see the data
 It's about the data
Sounds familiar? If you're thinking this is Ebola, actually, in this case, it's not
 But what is it, exactly? Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola, but if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high
And so, that's the clue
 We've known what it's capable of
 This leaves little in the way of market incentives for manufacturers to develop vaccines, unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries
 The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure
 The data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity, which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immunologically, and what type of reactions they promote
So these are the things that can be done, but to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure, we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases
 And yet, we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases
 And vaccines are our best defense
 Quantum biology asks a very simple question: Does quantum mechanics -- that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry -- also play a role inside the living cell? In other words: Are there processes, mechanisms, phenomena in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics? Now, quantum biology isn't new; it's been around since the early 1930s
 So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it
 Biologists, on the other hand, have got off lightly, in my view
The balls are the atoms, the sticks are the bonds between the atoms
If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then, as the fundamental foundation of reality itself, then it's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry
Ultimately, there's a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness
 But in everyday life, we can forget about it
Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world
 I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics
 That's very different from the warm, messy, noisy environment of a living cell
 He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s
 In 1944, he wrote a book called "What is Life?" It was tremendously influential
 So, Schrödinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life
 This is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world, quantum tunneling
 You can see a faint smudge of light in the right-hand box
 The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall, you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall
 Enzymes help this take place
Research carried out by my group -- so as I mentioned, I'm a nuclear physicist, but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in atomic nuclei, and so can apply those tools in other areas as well
 If the two strands of DNA then separate, leading to the process of replication, and the two protons are in the wrong positions, this can lead to a mutation
 We still don't know yet how important it is; this is still an open question
Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence, in one of the most important processes in biology, photosynthesis: plants and bacteria taking sunlight, and using that energy to create biomass
 Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking
 It's an object that behaves like a wave, so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other, but can follow multiple pathways at the same time
 Two quantum-entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field
 But I believe it's built on solid science
Thank you
 So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space! I can make free-floating lines, like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene
 So I took the objects out, and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens
 It was some good shit, man
 This was great, except for one thing: I was going to die
 I started drawing on the layers of glass, almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window, and another window, and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition
 The ocean is made up of thousands of elements
  Billy Graham is in the ocean; the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter -- there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard, in the ocean
 Way ahead of their time
 Each one is an archive of our culture, through our ripped-up media and matter, whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines
 Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside
 That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning
 It's called Pioneer Works
And I think that's the way you change the world
 Calls were recorded to tape
 I want that to sink in for a second: Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first
 WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product, which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages
 And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available
 And I think we really need to ask: Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly?
 You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys
 It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys
 Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure
 Every culture, every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth
 And as we get older, diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop
 We know that with age, the connections between neurons -- the way neurons talk to each other, the synapses -- they start to deteriorate; neurons die, the brain starts to shrink, and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases
 But we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease
 So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age, can we learn something about the brain? We know that as we get older, the blood changes as well, so these hormone-like factors change as we get older
 And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that, I want to talk you through an experiment that we did
 We had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings 20 to 89 years of age, and we measured over 100 of these communication factors, these hormone-like proteins that transport information between tissues
And then we take these top factors that I showed you, and we calculate their relative age, their biological age
 And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation, so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person
 You can see here, the person I highlighted with the green dot is about 70 years of age but seems to have a biological age, if what we're doing here is really true, of only about 45
 Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease? So in our lab, we're trying to understand these factors better, and many other groups are trying to understand, what are the true aging factors, and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age-related diseases?
 But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals
Many of us have probably had some problems with that
 So, it could remember where that hole was
So by all means, this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated -- it functions more like a younger mouse
 And most importantly, humans may have similar factors, because we can take young human blood and have a similar effect
 We test them cognitively, and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living
 And if that's the case, that could give us hope that what I showed you works in mice might also work in humans
 But maybe we discovered that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us, and it has just dried out
 And I've noticed an interesting shift
 This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology, which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories, like the ones you see behind me
The branching scheme of the tree was, in fact, such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became, over time, an important communication tool to map a variety of systems of knowledge
 We can see trees being used to map morality, with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices, as you can see here, with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe
 It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us
 And this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex
 And Llull was actually the precursor, the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree, a metaphor we use every single day, when we say, "Biology is a branch of science," when we say, "Genetics is a branch of science
 One of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized, independent cells, where there's no leader leading the whole process
 And here, you can actually see how visualization is being used
We can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species
 The image on the right is the only illustration that Darwin included in "The Origin of Species," which Darwin called the "Tree of Life
But even though recent, this metaphor of the network, is really already adopting various shapes and forms, and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy
 And these are actually 15 different typologies I've been collecting over time, and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor
 And on your right side, you have "Transient Structures and Unstable Networks" by Sharon Molloy, using oil and enamel on canvas
" It is a computer-generated map of a social network
 And I think the title really says it all -- it's called: "Galaxies Forming Along Filaments, Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web
But networks are also not just a new trend, and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such
  I can do things like read and write music
Language is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway
There are some other unusual things about me
"What thing?" I asked
  I looked like I was searching for Waldo
There's a reason for this, as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding
 I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though
I had to do a lot to get here, and my parents -- things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer, and on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse
One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind
 And this can make basic communication a challenge
  Thank you
  Thank you
 But it's more than that
 For people with ASD -- it has been speculated that many innovative scientists, researchers, artists, and engineers have it; like, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates are some examples
One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free, without judgment of social and physical consequences

Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment, which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients

 He slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing
 We are not white supremacists
 We don't think we're better than you, we just want to be away from you
 Rather, they emigrate there for friendliness, comfort, security, safety -- reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself
  The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church, a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus
 And for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston
 I was less exotic in this Whitopia
 
But what does it all mean? Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull phenomenon, full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls, and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias
As Americans, we often find ways to cook for each other, to dance with each other, to host with each other, but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities? It's a devastating irony, how we have gone forward as individuals, and backwards as communities
I ventured on my two-year, 27,000 mile journey to learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing, but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey

 And the question is: How did we come from there to here? How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes, minding their own business in a corner of Africa, into the rulers of planet Earth?
 But the truth is that, on the individual level, I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee

 Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps
Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes, we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers
 We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers, because we alone, of all the animals on the planet, can create and believe fictions, fictional stories
" And if you all believe this story that I've invented, then you will follow the same norms and laws and values, and you can cooperate
Now you may find it acceptable that yes, in the religious field, humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions
 What exactly are these things? They are what lawyers call legal fictions
 Take this green piece of paper, the dollar bill

 We'll talk more about this in a later video, but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations, the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force, that until now we've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence
 Or here's a video that I made as part of my show "Crash Course," talking about World War I:

 That's a high school topic, right? Which is odd, because it's a cool topic, but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway
 So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum
 So, in a quite understandable need for distraction, you're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of "series" should be than about the topic at hand: "serieses," "seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?" Or is it that the singular should be changed: one "serie," or "serum," just like the singular of "sheep" should be "shoop
 Today's question is: why? Like most simple questions, there's a very complex answer

 I was never taught that God judged differently based on gender

When I was 15 in 2005, I completed high school and I moved from Canada -- Saskatoon -- to Zawiya, my parents' hometown in Libya, a very traditional city
 The words "haram" -- meaning religiously prohibited -- and "aib" -- meaning culturally inappropriate -- were exchanged carelessly, as if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences
 And I found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates and colleagues, professors, friends, even relatives, beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations

And you're probably wondering how a women's rights organization was able to do this in communities which had previously opposed our sheer existence
 In certain communities, we actually had to go as far as saying the International Human Rights Declaration, which you opposed because it wasn't written by religious scholars, well, those same principles are in our book
 It's something that has now been replicated internationally, and while I am not saying it's easy -- believe me, it's not
 By saying that we're going to fight for women's rights and fight extremism with bombs and warfare, we completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues so that they're sustainable
It is not easy, challenging distorted religious messaging

So why did we do it? I think some people were genuinely upset, but I think for other people, it's because Twitter is basically a mutual approval machine

 The people I met were mangled

  At least, according to a 1973 "Book of Lists" survey which preceded all those online best, worst, funniest lists that you see today
More seriously, insects are essential
 It's been estimated that 1 out of every 3 bites of food is made possible by a pollinator

This back here was my brain cancer
 And everyone changes as well
While I was in the hospital, I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it
 There's more to me
" And so, the next day, I left the hospital against medical advice
  I chose this word, La Cura -- La Cura in Italian means "the cure" -- because in many different cultures, the word "cure" can mean many different things
And, it worked
 The La Cura website went viral
 I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts -- emails, social networking -- most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer, but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual
 For example, here we see Francesca Fini in her performance
 [Surgery]
 I chose the doctor I wanted to work with, I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in, and in the meanwhile, I was supported by thousands of people, none of whom felt pity for me
 And right before the operation, we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor, to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid
 Doctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult when they think about cancer
The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components

 So as part of this project, I thought it'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone
 He's from England, and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn
 I asked Carl, "What's the first thing you notice about a woman?" He said, "Tits
 We talked about running
Bill is an auditor, and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing
 
 He arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio
 SB: After 45 years of marriage, Anastasia's husband died two years ago,
so we asked if she had an old wedding picture
 The story that stayed with me the most was that of George, the photography club president, and his wife, Mary
 They met at a country-western club in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara
 At some point in their marriage, he says he consumed 54 beers in one day
At the end of the day, after we left Sun City, I told Alec that I didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting
 What was more interesting was how they managed to stay together
 What's more beautiful, I thought to myself, this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades?
 I'd graduated from college just a few months earlier and I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant
 Coming of age on the beaches of Southern California, I grew up in the middle of our nation's abortion wars
 It was a step towards the unknown
 According to the Guttmacher Institute, one in three women in America will have an abortion in their lifetime
 There are so many important issues that we can't talk about
Beyond abortion, pro-voice works on hard issues that we've struggled with globally for years, issues like immigration, religious tolerance, violence against women
 I wish I could tell you that when you decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find beautiful moments of breakthrough and gardens full of flowers, where listening and storytelling creates wonderful "a-ha" moments
 There's never a time when everyone will be on the same page, share the same lens, or know the same history
 So, let's talk about listening and how to be a good listener
 There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple
" If they say "fetus," you can say "fetus
 The same way that we hope people are interested in knowing us
 And she stood in front of her mirror at home, and she said the word "God
" "God
" "God
 Saying the word God did not turn this volunteer into a Christian, but it did make her a much better listener of Christian women
 It doesn't mean we all have to end up in the same place
 And it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another
 This time I was looking forward to the birth of my son
 It was a welcome, yet dramatic departure from what I experience when I talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion
 So I decided to go see a therapist
 I became so hysterical over her treatment, that eventually, she was just beaten behind closed doors
 She wound up working in Illinois for a time, before eventually returning to Thailand, which is where I ran into her again, at a political rally in Bangkok
I spent time in jails and brothels, interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement, NGO workers
 You probably think about a young girl or woman, who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp
As a journalist, I really care about how we relate to each other through language, and the way we tell that story, with all the gory, violent detail, the salacious aspects -- I call that "look at her scars" journalism
 but a whopping 68 percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day, in sectors like agricultural work, domestic work and construction
 That is food and care and shelter
 And somehow, these most essential workers are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today
 It's found in U
 military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan
It's found in Thailand's fishing industry
 We'll pay your fees
This is a huge problem
 If those workers run away, they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught
 That's like comparing the population of the world to the population of Los Angeles, proportionally speaking
 As for convictions, out of an estimated 5,700 convictions in 2013, fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking
I've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed
 It happens in systematically degraded work environments
 You might be thinking, oh, she's talking about failed states, or war-torn states, or -- I'm actually talking about the United States
 I found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor, and God knows who else
 And I would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation
 I totally agree
 This isn't a matter of buying a fair-trade peach and calling it a day, buying a guilt-free zone with your money
 This is the decision to change a system that is broken, and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long
 They were the emissaries of hope
 They need solidarity, because they're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today

 She could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits
  According to my niece and the 200-plus kids in the parking lot that day, this was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen
It is a blazing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio
 By 11 o'clock they had called numbers 21 through 25; this was going to be a while, and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store
  There were cardboard cut-out snowflakes covering the floor, glitter on every flat surface, and icicles all over the walls
 
 Would I be an advocate? Would I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her that I was in fact her aunt, not her father, and that she should be more careful and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides --  -- and while doing that, miss out on what was, to this point, the greatest moment of my niece's life
 Which side are you on? Are you unequivocally and without question antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty, pro-gun regulation, proponent of open borders and pro-union? Or, are you absolutely and uncompromisingly pro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty, a believer that the Second Amendment is absolute, anti-immigrant and pro-business? It's all or none, you're with us or against us
I work at a restaurant in town, I became really good friends with the busser
  And he said to her, [in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?" And she said, [in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend
 That is all
 She never made eye contact with me
Her individual morality was so strongly rooted that she had the courage to hold both things
 I don't see race or religion or sexuality
" But I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love, it's apathy
As individuals, as allies, as humans, we need to be able to hold both things: both the good and the bad, the easy and the hard
 And what if duality is just the first step? What if through compassion and empathy and human interaction we are able to learn to hold two things? And if we can hold two things, we can hold four, and if we can hold four, we can hold eight, and if we can hold eight, we can hold hundreds
So, back to Toledo, Ohio
 And top all of that off with the frustration that I'm wearing an out-of-character tight-fitting purple t-shirt, so this whole store can see my boobs, to make sure this exact same thing doesn't happen
 And I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard -- not my sister, not my girlfriend, and certainly not my niece
"
 As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door, I turn to my sister and say, "Was it worth it?" And she said, "Are you kidding me? Did you see the look on her face? This was the greatest day of her life!"  "It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat, it was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of
 And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didn't know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working, and is there a better way out there that we could try instead?
 And I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people, from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them -- it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances -- to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal
First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me
 If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly
 So there you go, right? That's how we think it works
 He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage
 Let's try something different
 They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels
Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us
 Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know -- But fortunately, there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time
 It was called the Vietnam War
 Ninety-five percent of them just stopped
Looking at this, there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction
 Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang, but actually almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that
 We shame them
 Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system
 João Goulão, to look at all this new evidence, and they came back and they said, "Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but" -- and this is the crucial next step -- "take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society
 But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do: a massive program of job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses
 So say you used to be a mechanic
 And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal, what they said is, as they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society
Now, that's the political implications
 Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group, and we've created a society where, for a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park
 You are angry a lot of the time, and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us, right? Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you
 Get an addict, all the people in their life, gather them together, confront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up, we're going to cut you off
 So I'll read it to you
 My father cannot force me to marry
 No one in the world can force me to marry
 I'll marry when I want
"
I am from Malawi
 It's a hurtful thing
 In these initiation camps, you are taught how to sexually please a man
 Most girls end up pregnant
 Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children
 Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage
   I call her amazing because she is
 I knew what I wanted in life
 Your little sister has a baby
When I compared the two stories between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time in our community?"
So we tried
 It was very hard, but we pushed
 And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18
We did not stop there
 Every day, when the members of Parliament were entering, we were telling them, "Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have much technology like here, but we have our small phones
 This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment
 In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues at heart every time
And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone
 I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation
 This is the moment where a girl and a girl, and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want
"
My colleagues and I are fascinated by the science of moving dots
 So what are these dots? Well, it's all of us
 And wouldn't it be great if we could understand all this movement? If we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it
 And the problem is they can't know them because they'd have to watch every second of every game, remember it and process it
 At least they couldn't until now
 So what have we taught the machine to see?
 Things that most casual fans would know
 Or if he does stop, but he doesn't stop close enough, it's probably not a pick-and-roll
So, here's an example
 We're at the point where almost every single contender for an NBA championship this year is using our software, which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball
The coaches want players to take good shots
 So if I'm standing near the basket and there's nobody near me, it's a good shot
 We can see: Where is the shot? What's the angle to the basket? Where are the defenders standing? What are their distances? What are their angles? For multiple defenders, we can look at how the player's moving and predict the shot type
Those are NBA players
 On the x-axis, we have the shot probability
 On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability
 And the reason that's important is that there are lots of 47s out there
 And so it's really important to know if the 47 that you're considering giving 100 million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes good shots
 It was one of the most exciting games in basketball
 And our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second, and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before
 Now unfortunately, I can't show you that video
 So, here is us
 I'm going to show you that moment and all the insights of that moment
 Down three
 Twenty seconds left

 Back to Daria
 The crowd goes wild
That's roughly how it happened
Way to go, Daria
 You do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement
Perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings, better plan our cities
 I believe that with the development of the science of moving dots, we will move better, we will move smarter, we will move forward
So the call went out
 "Female soldiers: Become a part of history
 And for them it was not about politics, it was about serving with purpose
 They also wore body armor
 You could love CrossFit, and really like cross-stitch
 And there was the night that Isabel, another one of their teammates, found the things that they were looking for, and received an Impact Award from the Rangers who said that without her, the things and the people they were looking for that night would never have been found
That night and so many others, they went out to prove themselves, not only for one another, but for everybody who would come after them

 As he put it, "If you were an athlete, you were a dumb dodo

 He inflicted pain, and he treated it

 But the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine

On a business trip to Florida in the early 1980s, Bonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa
 The house belonged to the Zacchini family, who were something like American circus royalty
 But now they were like him: retired
 But still, I love imagining it
 The strongman and the human cannonballs reunited, showing off old scars, and new ones
 Maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history, which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life
 And it made it impossible for him to ignore in others
But it was also true for my mom
 But as I saw Bonica's pain -- a testament to his fully lived life -- I started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds

 Not only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States, but also my wife and I have visited more than 145 countries in the world, and the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth
 That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer, for instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself? Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work?
 When I was in office as governor of Georgia, one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison
 Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much
 This is not a rare thing, although it's against the law in most countries
Another very serious thing is honor killings, where a family with misinterpretation, again, of a holy scripture -- there's nothing in the Quran that mandates this -- will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve, or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing
 There were about 12
 The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year, and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery, and that 80 percent of those sold are women, into sexual slavery
 If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin, they can do it for 1,000 dollars
 Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society
 These are the kind of things that go on
  That's true
 But during that time, there were many white people that didn't think that racial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing that exists today, because the average man really doesn't care
When you're a child, anything and everything is possible
 And as a four-year-old, I had the opportunity to sail for the first time
 I made my mind up there and then that one day, somehow, I was going to sail around the world
 Every single day for eight years, I had mashed potato and baked beans, which cost 4p each, and gravy was free
 Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy
 I spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal
 Just like in my dreams, there were amazing parts and tough parts
 The bar was now much, much higher
 This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board
 Eight sail changes in 12 hours
 If I said to you all now, "Go off into Vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months," that's quite a task
 That's food, fuel, clothes, even toilet roll and toothpaste
" What we have out there is all we have
 And it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone and having two choices: I either put that stone to one side and learn more about it, or I put that stone back and I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world
 I was fascinated by coal, fundamental to our global energy needs, but also very close to my family
 In 2008, I picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials to extract from the ground: copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29
 And yet, our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly, exponentially
 I started traveling less, doing less, using less
And I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy for 150 years, where we take a material out of the ground, we make something out of it, and then ultimately that product gets thrown away, and yes, we do recycle some of it, but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end, not by design
 If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up, we could build a future that really could work in the long term
 This was something to work towards
So how would you shift from linear to circular? Well, the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world, with leading businesses within the world, with the biggest convening platforms in the world, and with governments
 When young people see the economy through a circular lens, they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon
 Many said it wouldn't catch on, but it did, and just 20 years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands in this room here today
Thank you
 Later that year, he took it out for the first public test drive, and -- true story -- crashed into a wall
 To put that in perspective, that's the same as a 737 falling out of the sky every working day
 Right? It's not sunny, it's rainy, and you want to do anything other than drive
 And the reason why is this: Traffic is getting worse
 So if you take the average commute time in America, which is about 50 minutes, you multiply that by the 120 million workers we have, that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day
 Now, that's a big number, so let's put it in perspective
 And then, there are those of us who don't have the privilege of sitting in traffic
 He's an incredibly capable guy, but he just happens to be blind, and that means instead of a 30-minute drive to work in the morning, it's a two-hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit or asking friends and family for a ride
 Well, I'm here to tell you that's like me saying that if I work really hard at jumping, one day I'll be able to fly
 All the time he's been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway
 Now, if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car, say with collision mitigation braking, we're going to put some package of technology on there, and that's this curve, and it's going to have some operating properties, but it's never going to avoid all of the accidents, because it doesn't have that capability
 But let's look at it from a different direction for a moment
 So let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing
 That's like comparing how fast I run to the speed of light
And then finally, there's how the system can handle uncertainty
 Let's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world
So this is our vehicle
 It starts by understanding where it is in the world, by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two, and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment
 It's an incredibly complicated problem by comparison
 So here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right, but not just construction in isolation, of course
 And of course, if anyone's breaking the rules, the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it's not just a car, it's actually a police officer
When we're out on the road, other people have expectations: So, when a cyclist puts up their arm, it means they're expecting the car to yield to them and make room for them to make a lane change
 Now, we don't have to deal with just ducks
 Watch this bird fly across in front of us
 The car reacts to that
 Unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention
 They started to pull forward, and fortunately for everyone, this cyclists reacts, avoids, and makes it through the intersection
 And off we go
 What you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end because you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point, and then a driver is going to say, "This feels safe," and climb into the back, and something ugly will happen
 Right
 We will be tracking your progress with huge interest
 Thanks so much, Chris
This is my great uncle, my father's father's younger brother
 The fever climbed and climbed
 His wife was taking care of him, but nothing she did made a difference, and when they got the local doctor in, nothing he did mattered either
They flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital
There was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections didn't exist yet
 My great uncle was not lucky
 He was in the hospital for a week, shaking with chills, dehydrated and delirious, sinking into a coma as his organs failed
Nothing worked
 He died
If you look back through history, most people died the way my great uncle died
 People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance
 Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food, by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other
 Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest, so there are infections moving across the world for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics available on the market, two drugs might work with side effects, or one drug, or none
 The gene that creates that resistance, known as NDM, has now spread from India into China, Asia, Africa, Europe and Canada, and the United States
What you didn't think about, none of us do, is that antibiotics support almost all of modern life
 How many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees? A recent study estimates that without antibiotics, one out of ever six would die
Next, we'd probably lose surgery
 Strep throat used to cause heart failure
 That British project I mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year also predicts that if we can't get this under control by 2050, not long, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year
How did we get to this point where what we have to look forward to is those terrifying numbers? The difficult answer is, we did it to ourselves
 Penicillin was sold over the counter until the 1950s
 In the United States, 50 percent of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary
 Forty-five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor's offices are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help
 On much of the planet, most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives, not to cure illnesses, but to fatten them up and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in
Can we avert it? There are companies working on novel antibiotics, things the superbugs have never seen before
 We need those new drugs badly, and we need incentives: discovery grants, extended patents, prizes, to lure other companies into making antibiotics again
But that probably won't be enough
 Here's why: Evolution always wins
 Bacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes
 Every time we use an antibiotic, we give the bacteria billions of chances to crack the codes of the defenses we've constructed
This is asymmetric warfare, but we can change the outcome
 We could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next
I know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming, but if you've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change, or read the label on a box of crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil, you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem
 We won't get 70 years to find our way back out again
Thank you very much
 Clarity gets to the point
 It's sincere
 Is it?
This is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love, mainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry
 
 So you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything, so I was trying to think: Where might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't? And sure enough, not long after, one evening after a Chinese meal, this arrived, and I thought, "Ah, bing, ideagasm!"  I've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but when you think about them -- if you think about them -- they really don't
["'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff"] David Rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book "Fraud" because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do
 Confidential
 And so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of all right, we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city
"]
 So I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be
  I don't even have to complete the sentence
 All right
["Unuseful mystery"] What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up? And we see this all the time
 Part of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful, and frankly, I don't think it is at all
 This is using all the same elements
 It's beautiful
 Okay? And maybe some of you know where this is going
"You moved to New York with the clothes on your back, the cash in your pocket, and your eyes on the prize
 It was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash and all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web --  -- and also that dot next to "You're on," that's not a period, that's a trademark
So to me, this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably, clearly wrong
So I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights on the uses of clarity and mystery in my work, and maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life, or maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over-sharing
Let me take a step back
 I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules, who expects too much, who thinks far too highly of myself, by daring to believe I'm equal --  -- superior to a man
 You don't want to be that rebel woman, until you realize that you very much are that woman, and cannot imagine being anyone else
 We are people with different bodies, gender expressions, faiths, sexualities, class backgrounds, abilities, and so much more
 We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us, as much as we account for what we have in common
 When I drive to work, I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume
  Poetry, right? I am utterly mortified by my music choices
 
I firmly believe in man work, which is anything I don't want to do, including --  -- all domestic tasks, but also: bug killing, trash removal, lawn care and vehicle maintenance
 I enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
 If a woman wants to take her husband's name, that is her choice, and it is not my place to judge
 The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice; the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose
 
 We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal
 They're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a feminist," for fear of what that label means, for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations
 As the moment faded, cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not Beyoncé was, indeed, a feminist
 But -- when I justify bad choices, I make it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve, and I need to own that
 I call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened
 I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself
 I read the words of women who might understand a story like mine, and women who looked like me, and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin
 And in my other, I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman
I am a bad feminist, I am a good woman, I am trying to become better in how I think, and what I say, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human
 I hope that we can all be a little bit brave, when we most need such bravery
